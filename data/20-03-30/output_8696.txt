Mask Maker , Mask Maker , Print Me A Mask  Melissa Rabideau is the founder of TinkrLab , a STEAM-based company in Okemos .
She and others are using 3-D printers to create masks and face shields for health care workers treating coronavirus patients .
Kevin Lavery / WKAR-MSU  Health care workers across the country are in dire need of personal protective gear to combat the spread of the coronavirus .
As they make do as best they can , some people outside the medical field are making this gear themselves using 3-D printers .
Listen  Listening .
/  4:59  Melissa Rabideau :  About a week ago ( March 23 ) , I saw some different people who were 3-D printing these masks .
I thought , that 's cool .
But then I started actually thinking about it going , OK .
I know a lot of different people who have 3-D printers .
What would happen if we all came together ? So , I started reaching out to East Lansing public schools ; we work really closely with them , and I found out they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hey , let 's get this started .
Let 's go .
Kevin Lavery :  How exactly does a 3-D printer work ?  Rabideau :  I like to relate it to a hot glue gun .
The glue goes in the back end and it comes out soft .
Same thing with a 3-D printer .
The material at the top of the printer funnels down into the extruder , which is the heated piece down at the bottom .
It melts and it comes out and lays flat layer by layer , and as it 's laid out , it re-hardens .
Lavery :  What material are you using to make these masks ?  Rabideau :  This material is called PLA .
It 's a non-toxic plant based material .
It 's manufactured by a company called 3DXTECH , which is a Grand Rapids manufacturer .
So it 's really cool that we 're making all of these products out of a Michigan made material .
Lavery :  How do you actually program the printer to fit a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fit properly ; that it 's what the people for whom you 're making it really need ?  Rabideau :  That was one of the things that when looking at the masks , we said , OK .
is this something that people actually want ? I do n't want to put material and resources and people 's time into something that they ca n't utilize and that they ca n't actually have ready for them .
We 're pretty much doing a one size fits all type model because there 's so many different shapes of faces and sizes of people .
It would be impossible for us at this point to be able to fit all of them .
That 's also another reason that we are going to be moving really heavily into the face shields .
A face shield is going to be able to double team with a mask that the provider may already have .
They can wear the face shield , and with that we are 3-D printing the band that goes around the head and we 're laser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it take to make one mask and one face shield ?  Rabideau :  So , the masks .
depending on the type of printer that you have , it will take anywhere from four to six hours to make a mask .
The face shields take about an hour to print the band and it takes less than a minute to cut the shield .
So , we can produce a lot of them a lot quicker when we move to the face shields .
Lavery :  Is this a 24 hour operation ?  Rabideau :  The really cool part about all of this has been the people that have joined in with what we 're doing .
We have over 150 individuals running over 200 3-D printers on these projects .
That 's happened within the last week .
We have individuals , we have some small businesses and we also have some schools that are utilizing their printers that they have for their classes .
They 're not being used right now , so the teachers are printing for us .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage industry , then ?  Rabideau :  Yeah , it 's pretty much just jump in full force .
With all of the shelter in place orders and all of that , our business went from operating to a complete standstill in a matter of a day .
I can curl up in a ball on the floor and cry because I do n't know what 's going to happen .
Or , I can turn my attention to , how can I use what I have available to me -- 3-D printers and contacts of our customers who have done 3-D printing -- and how can we at least do something and shift the focus off of ourselves and instead be part of the solution .
