34,000 more hospital beds and everything else to know about COVID-19 today , Tuesday March 31 .
A partnership between public and private health sectors reached .
The Australian government has made a deal with the states and the private hospital system that will bring over 34,000 more beds into rotation as the number of people with COVID-19 grows .
The agreement will also see 105,000 full and part-time hospital staff repurposed -- including 57,000 nurses and midwives .
Hospital staff were under threat of losing their jobs when the government last week announced a pause on elective surgeries , which is responsible for bringing in most of the revenue to private and Catholic hospitals .
" It guarantees them their future and their support both during the crisis and beyond , but most importantly , it brings their resources to the fight against coronavirus in Australia , " Health Minister Greg Hunt told parliament at 1pm today .
" Today we make very significant strides in improving capacity , " he added .
Discussions over this deal continued long into the night over the weekend , and Hunt said this agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private hospitals " .
" We will be guaranteeing the viability along with the states of all 657 private hospitals in Australia and we are doing this with a Commonwealth guarantee , then state partnerships and then the individual private hospitals relying on the source income that they have from the ordinary operations .
Those three things together will mean that our hospitals will be able to continue , an important part of this is that in return for our guarantee , there is a guarantee of flexibility , capacity , participation and staff retention from the private hospitals , " said Hunt .
A third of intensive care units are within the private system , and they will now be available to COVID-19 patients as a result of this announcement .
" At any one time , there are approximately 2,200 ventilated intensive care beds in Australia .
At the moment , we are using just over 20 of those for patients who are suffering from COVID-19 , " said Deputy Chief Medical officer , Dr Nick Coatsworth .
The Unexpected Silver Lining  Mamamia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its Going To Be Ok  ADVERTISEMENT  " With immediate expansion , repurposing of other ventilator machines , including anaesthetic machines , and use of the private sector , we can expand to 4400 .
Our target capacity for ventilated intensive care beds in Australia currently stands at 7500 .
"  Chief Nursing and Midwifery officer Alison McMillan asked nurses to understand that their profession is focused on patients and to be flexible with upcoming changes .
" This is going to mean that we are going to have to ask them to be flexible about how they work and where they work because the work that we are going to need them to do might require them to work in a public hospital or in an environment that they may not have worked in before , " she explained .

Mutating virus now has eight strains .
The coronavirus is mutating -- as viruses do -- and eight strains are now making the rounds globally , medical experts say .
The good news is that the mutations are not more lethal , said Trevor Bedford , whose website NextStrain .
is tracking the virus ' genome from samples provided to him from throughout the world .
Researchers are dissecting the genomes of coronavirus and discovering the strains that have emerged since the virus is thought to have first jumped from animals to humans in a Wuhan , China , wildlife market late last year .
The work shows how the virus is migrating and splitting into similar but new subtypes .
" What is in question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of disease or the transmissibility or other things that we as humans care about .
"  The strains emerging are only slightly tweaked , with no variations in lethality , experts said .
ADVERTISEMENT  " The observed rate of mutation ( about two mutations per month ) is completely normal for a virus , " Bedford wrote on Twitter .
" Flu and the common cold have similar mutation rates .
Even a bit faster for flu .
"  So , my prediction is that we should see occasional mutations to the spike protein of #SARSCoV2 that allow the virus to partially escape from vaccines or existing " herd " immunity , but that this process will most likely take years rather than months .
12/12  While the genomes retrieved so far are providing reassuring information about how the virus can be stopped and whether social distancing is working - indications are that it is - they do not provide more than a sketch , the experts said .
