In the throes of coronavirus COVID-19 quarantines and social distancing , everyone is looking for a little bit of humor .
The outbreak is no laughing matter -- but still , people are making memes to blow off steam and be happier at home .
One Breaking Bad fan put together a hilarious spoof on a classic scene from the show that 's been reimagined for the current coronavirus climate .
Anyone who watched the series is sure to laugh at this weirdly appropriate scene .
First , a recap of the classic storage unit cash scene from ' Breaking Bad '  The show Breaking Bad is about a high school chemistry named Walter White who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer .
Instead of dying quietly , Walt decides to begin manufacturing meth with a former student to raise money for his treatments and to provide for his family after death .
However , his " ends justify the means " approach to a life of crime does n't go as planned .
Instead of being content after earning huge amounts of money , Walt becomes obsessed with earning more and becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family and eventually , his life .
In Season 5 , Episode 8 , " Gliding All Over , " Walt 's wife Skyler brings him to a storage unit to show him how much cash he has .
Walt 's shocked expression shows he had no idea how much he amassed .
The coronavirus spoof replaces Walt 's cash stash with toilet paper  The entire country has been feeling the effects of people hoarding toilet paper during the coronavirus pandemic .
With stores sold out and jacking up prices for this necessary product , the memes are becoming ubiquitous .
But none are as funny as the Breaking Bad video that juxtaposes the pile of cash with toilet paper hoarding .
In the parody , which is called " Breaking Bad Coronavirus Parody -- Walter Wipe , " Skyler brings Walt to the storage facility to confront him about his hoarding .
But instead of showing him a giant pile of cash , she pulls back the sheet to reveal a stack of toilet paper .
Her words remain the same , making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two-ply stash in the spoof video  " This is it , " Skyler says .
" This is what you 've been working for .
I rented this place and I started bringing it here because I did n't know what else to do .
"  She continues , " I gave up counting it -- I had to -- because it was just so much .
" These words were dramatic as Skyler stood over a mound of illegally earned money .
But standing over a pile of toilet paper ? It 's a totally different vibe .
The " Walter Wipe " video is n't the only Breaking Bad clip getting the coronavirus treatment .
There 's the classic photo of Huell sitting at home in his nearly empty apartment , which fans are using to encourage each other to stay home .
