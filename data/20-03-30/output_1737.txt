J&amp;J said it would start human testing by September , with an eye on having it ready under an emergency use authorisation in early 2021 , far quicker than the typical 18 month period that it takes for vaccines to be tested , approved and then manufactured .
J&amp;J Chief Scientific Officer Dr Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now , even before it has a signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start making the vaccine at risk , without knowing for sure that it works .
" That is the only option for us to get it on time , " Dr Stoffels said in a phone interview .
The company has a manufacturing plant in the Netherlands that can make up to 300 million doses of vaccine , Dr Stoffels said , adding that " absolutely will not be sufficient for the world .
"  Stay updated with BT newsletters  He said J&amp;J is starting to build a plant in the United States now so it can be ready to manufacture vaccines by the end of the year , when data from its clinical trials will show whether the vaccine works .
Nearly half of the US$1 billion will come from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ( BARDA ) , which is looking to expand on J&amp;J 's previous collaboration with the agency .
Dr Stoffels said the company is also scouting for manufacturing plants in other parts of Europe and Asia that are capable of making the type of vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J&amp;J has not given any doses of its vaccine to humans .
But Dr Stoffels said the coronavirus vaccine will be based on the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine , which has been widely used in people , and the company believes it will prove safe .
Safety testing of vaccines is even more important than for treatments as they are given to healthy people to prevent infection .
That could be 1 billion people or more around the world .
In lab studies , the vaccine candidate has produced strong neutralising antibodies to the virus - the type needed to make a successful vaccine .
