( CNN ) -- Hundreds of trekkers are stranded on high-altitude trekking trails across Nepal due to a nationwide lockdown designed to contain the coronavirus spread .
There are about 500 foreign trekkers on at least four trekking routes unable to return due to the lockdown , which started Tuesday and will last for a week , according to Shradha Shrestha , a spokeswoman for the Nepal Tourism Board .
" We are working with multiple government agencies to rescue the trekkers and bring them to Kathmandu , so that we can coordinate with the embassies to fly them back home , " Shrestha told CNN .
" Several embassies such as the German and French are already planning to send chartered flights to some of these areas to rescue the trekkers , " Shrestha added .
The tourism board has launched a website to make it easier for the stranded trekkers to reach out to authorities , said Shrestha .
The British embassy in Kathmandu asked its citizens in Nepal who are looking to return to the UK to send their details to staff .
" We 're working closely with carriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will contact you ASAP , " tweeted the embassy .
Nepal 's government announced earlier this month the spring climbing season for all the Himalayan peaks in the country , including the world 's highest Mount Everest , would be canceled due to coronavirus .
Climbing permits for Mount Everest are canceled until the end of April , said Nepal 's Tourism Secretary Kedar Bahadur Adhikari .
The decision came at the start of this year 's closely watched climbing season , which was already getting underway amid concerns around overcrowding on the Earth 's highest peak .
Permits to climb Everest cost around $11,000 .
Breathing is hampered by the extreme altitudes on the mountain , so an outbreak of coronavirus -- which often causes respiratory problems -- could have been particularly devastating at an Everest camp .
Nepal has three cases of coronavirus confirmed so far , according to the Nepal Health Ministry data .
