But each day that the coronavirus continues to spread threatens those events from taking place at all .
As we approach some important dates for teams to start getting together , one NFL owner made a prediction for how the 2020 season will play out .

Blank said that the NFL would likely make a litany of changes to let the games go on while limiting coronavirus exposure .
Changes might include shorter training camps , fewer preseason games , and daily testing .
But the most important thing would be no fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and I use the word speculate because that 's really all it is , I would say yes .
Only because it 's so far away from where we are today .
I could easily see camps being shorter , players being tested on a daily basis , things of that nature .
No fan attendance .
Things like that .
" We may have fewer preseason games , which probably would n't be the end of the world .
But I think by September , my hope is by the time the regular season starts , that we 'll be able to bring people together in some form or fashion in a safe manner and play .
"  The NFL is n't the only league pondering the idea of playing games in front of empty stands .
Over in England , the Premier League are attempting to play finish their suspended season .
One proposal suggests playing their final 92 games this summer in one region of the midlands with no fans in attendance .
Exclusive -- Premier League plans have developed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games in midlands June/July .
