A pathogen , coronavirus , and the disease it causes , Covid-19 , have hurled the world into a spin and are causing it to change faster than governments or citizens or both would have done .
That is what crises do .
During crises leaders emerge from national to departmental levels .
They think on their feet , take decisions swiftly and organise teams and structures to tackle the emergencies and save people , systems and countries .
Who fits the bill in Kenya ?  When there are crises such as Covid-19 , governments must re-examine , reassess and evaluate their systems and structures to ensure they work and are fit for purpose .
Even more importantly , they should be primed to work swimmingly in a crisis in the future .
Nairobi must get in tune and in tandem .
The initial reactions by governments , from Beijing shutting down the entire economy of Wuhan province , itself bigger than many European countries , to South Africa 's total lockdown , are meant to stop the patient bleeding , so to speak .
Coronavirus is disrupting the established order , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways of life .
Also Read  That means when the coronavirus storm has ceased , there will be new words and deeds in Kenya and the leaders to enforce them in place or waiting in the wings .
NEW ORDER  It is the things that have brought Kenyans , and most people of the world , together that are suddenly under serious threat .
Places of worship and parlours of tipple , places of wet and dry markets , planes and trains , and sports and entertainment arenas , for example , have emptied .
Presidents , prime ministers , ministers , governors and assorted government spokespeople the world over are visible and voluble .
They are addressing their constituents daily , weekly , or ad hoc on progress being made by the government against Covid-19 , the numbers of the afflicted and fatalities .
So Nairobi on Wednesday imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew in peacetime .
New Delhi forced a complete lockdown on its 1 .
billion people .
Kampala closed its borders and shut down public transport , and in Kigali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populace how to wash hands .
HEALTH WORKERS  But Covid-19 marches on .
On Thursday , the number of deaths from the coronavirus in the UK hit 578 , up by 119 in just 24 hours , from the previous total .
It was the highest figure so far for the UK , but all around the country , there is a consensus that there 's a tsunami coming .
At 8 o'clock ( 11pm Kenyan time ) , Brits , led by infected Prime Minister Boris Johnson , Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak and infected heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles , applauded from balconies and doorsteps , health workers who lead the struggle against Covid-19 .
Brits understand that their health workers , the men and women who make their beloved , but neglected and overwhelmed , National Health Service ( NHS ) work , deserve their undivided support and solidarity ahead of the imminent storm .
Kenya 's health workers have a long-standing raft of grouses , which GoK must address .
But the immediate thing to do , which the Brits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
ECONOMY BLEEDING  Wards have been discharged and converted into near or complete intensive units .
Teams of doctors and nurses have been trained and readied for the expected explosion of coronavirus .
Over in the United States , debate raged about whether the shutdown of the economy imposed in certain states to stem the march of coronavirus should be lifted by Easter .
That 's what President Trump wants to do , arguing that the cure must not be worse than the problem .
President Trump holds that the longer the economy stays shut , the more painful it is for Americans and the more difficult it will be to restart it once coronavirus is contained .
He makes sense , but more importantly he faces an election in November that could well turn on Covid-19 .
Unlike Trump , Nairobi must not trade in the health of Kenyans for political profit .
President Kenyatta has so far done a commendable job of rallying Kenyans around the common cause of defeating coronavirus .
He must stay the course .
ADEQUATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya has the equipment for testing for the coronavirus on a national scale and tracking the infected .
He will ensure health workers , who are on the frontline in the struggle against Covid-19 , have the best personal protection equipment .
This will keep them safe so that they may make others safe .
The Covid-19 crisis should teach Kenya how to create a world-class health service .
