COVID-19 is deadly in nursing homes , staff and health unit working to keep virus out  ' What disturbs me and concerns me is the likelihood of having a severe outcome , the likelihood of having deaths , ' said Dr .
Charles Gardner , medical officer of health for Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit  Nine residents have died of COVID-19 in one Bobcaygeon nursing home this week , and the news has devastated not only the region 's lead health official , but area nursing home staff as well .
" I get choked up when I start thinking about it , " said Scott Strandholt , administrator at Bay Haven in Collingwood .
" Families have entrusted us to keep their residents safe , and we 're doing everything we possibly can .
"  But the respiratory virus has already proved extremely dangerous for elderly people , with or without pre-existing conditions .
" It 's deadly , " said Strandholt .
" That 's why we have so many precautions at this point .
We 're trying to be prepared , we 're trying to respond quickly and isolate any potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  While the nursing home staff are practising physical distancing where possible , their jobs are hands-on .
There are also some residents without the cognitive capacity to comply with directives such as covering a cough or keeping two metres away from others .
The death toll among seniors worldwide and the natural fragility of many nursing home residents is also worrisome for Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit 's medical officer of health , Dr .
Charles Gardner .
" What disturbs me and concerns me is the likelihood of having a severe outcome , the likelihood of having deaths , " said Gardner during a media briefing today .
" These are very vulnerable people together in large numbers in an environment in which , if we 're not extremely careful , the virus can spread rapidly and can result in a large number of deaths .
"  Gardner said the health unit has n't confirmed any cases of COVID-19 in the Simcoe-Muskoka region , but he also could n't rule it out .
" We typically have a number of outbreaks at this time from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flus and colds , " said Gardner , adding there are outbreaks of that nature at long-term care facilities in the region .
" Some of them , we 're not sure what the causal organism is .
We are monitoring it very closely .
"  At Bay Haven , any resident who has been to the hospital must be isolated for three to five days and will be monitored for any symptoms of the virus .
Strandholt said he 's been working with the medical director Dr .
Sohail Ghandi , president of the Ontario Medical Association , to develop protocols for isolation and any COVID-19 emergencies .
Gardner also said the public health unit is closely monitoring the region 's long-term care homes and working with them to put safety protocols in place to limit the virus ' spread .
" There 's lots of information out there and so we are deciphering all of that , " said Strandholt .
" It 's like drinking from a fire hose right now , the information that 's coming out .
"  Strandholt has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent his career in nursing homes and long-term care .
He said he does n't recall a virus as dangerous as COVID-19 .
" The management team and our nurses and frontline people are apprehensive and they 're scared , and they 're looking for answers , " said " We are grateful they 're showing up for work .
They 're going to be the unsung heroes of this pandemic .
"  The Ontario government announced today it has added another $10 million to its fiscal response to COVID-19 to help seniors self-isolate .
A press release from the province suggests the funds could be used to subsidize grocery , meal , and medication delivery to seniors living at home .
The province has also promised $20 million over two years for greater protections for seniors in retirement homes , and $243 million for long-term care homes to support 24/7 screening , additional staffing , enhanced cleaning and sanitation , and added surge capacity .
" We must do everything in our power to care for and support Ontario 's most vulnerable population , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to assure you that we are working around the clock to assist and care for Ontario 's seniors , especially those in long-term care , during this unprecedented time .
