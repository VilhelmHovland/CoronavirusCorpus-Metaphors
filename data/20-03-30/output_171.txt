* If you have symptoms of the coronavirus , call the NZ Covid-19 Healthline on 0800 358 5453 ( +64 9 358 5453 for international SIMs ) or call your GP - do n't show up at a medical centre  Even with no other symptoms , loss of smell is important enough to warn clinicians to use full protective equipment around a patient , who should be isolated on that basis alone , a professional body of UK ear nose and throat specialists has warned public health experts this week .
Otago University senior lecturer Dr Mei Peng specialises in olfactory senses , and is seeking New Zealanders who have or have had the disease , and are willing to answer a short questionnaire about changes they have experienced to their sense of smell or taste , which will contribute to an international collaboration to learn more .
She said global reports increasingly show this can happen long before other symptoms , and awareness and understanding of it could help reduce the spread .
" We want to use it as an early warning sign for self-screening - it 's become very clear Covid-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incubation period we could spread the virus to other people , so the earlier we detect the infections , the earlier we could help to control it .
" It 's certainly something that we should keep an eye out for - sudden loss of smell is rare in healthy young people , so if that kind of symptom appears we definitely should keep an eye on it , and possibly contact clinicians and do better self-isolation .

Without resources or time to work on the mechanism causing the symptoms , they are gathering standardised observational data about how and when the sensory changes happen , and the patterns in different places .
Smell is responsible for most of our sense of taste , Dr Peng said .
" The findings so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportions of people who experience it varies for countries .
" In Germany the reports are two out of three people experience a sudden loss of smell and taste before any other symptoms .
But in South Korea , their reported statistic is one third .
"  One patient from the US , who the group has already worked with , was a useful test case .
" It 's very interesting , she had a very sudden loss of smell and taste , so we asked her to try a few things - to try a dilute sugar solution to see if she could perceive sweetness , and sour , bitter and spicy food , to see if she could taste that .
" The person would report that they do n't taste it as much .
They could n't taste hot sauce anymore - she knows her usual tolerance , and she usually could n't tolerate that hot sauce .
"  Those tests also demonstrated a key alarm bell the group want to sound .
" She had very mild symptoms otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell was very noticeable .
" That makes us feel a little bit alarmed , because a very healthy young person could have no other symptoms , but have these very mild symptoms that you could easily ignore , and could also be spreading that virus to other people - so it 's worthwhile looking into it .
"  Dr Peng said the research is moving rapidly .
The team are currently finalising the questions they want to ask patients , including whether to ask them to try simple taste tests , and are translating the questionnaire into all the languages it will be collected in .
They hope to distribute the questionnaire in the next week and gather and analyse the answers soon afterwards .
She hopes New Zealand patients - or people who believe they may have been exposed to the disease - will get in touch immediately , to help their efforts .
" This epidemic is affecting us all , and it 's crucial that we all help in any way we can .
"  She said changes in smell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Impaired smell ability can be linked to Parkinson 's Disease , Alzheimer 's Disease , dementias - there 's quite a few links between smell perception and the neurological disease .
" Nerve degeneration is what people believe it is , but it 's hard research to do on human participants - there 's practical challenges .
"  Dr Peng said when Covid-19 patients recover from the illness their sense of smell returns - the loss of smell is not permanent .
The research initiative was started by researchers at the Monell Centre , University of Pennsylvania , and US Neuroscience and Society Lab .

And just to put a dash of humour on this article .
For all of those who walk dogs .
Everytime you pick ' one ' up , you may not smell it anymore .
My advice would be to comprehensively avoid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search of a rudimentary confirmation you may have Covid 19 could compromise your health .
Please be aware that such testing is neither official nor conclusive .
You have been warned .
