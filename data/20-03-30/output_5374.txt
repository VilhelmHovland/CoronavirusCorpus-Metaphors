Most doctors and paramedics leading the fight against COVID-19 in Kashmir on Monday voiced concern over inadequate medical infrastructure , and said there is a lack of manpower to deal with the pandemic if it intensifies in the valley .
Doctors treating COVID-19 patients claimed they are stretched and unable to get proper rest .
Some medical workers also complained of shortage of personal protective equipment ( PPE ) .
Dr Suhail Nayak , president of Doctors Association Kashmir ( DAK ) , said there is an urgent need for staff that can run ICUs and high-dependency units .
" I believe that even after these restrictions and lockdown , the COVID-19 cases will rise .
I have no doubt that the government is focused on the COVID-19 battle , but the doctors are facing certain problems .
For example , we lack manpower -- the real manpower , which is trained to run the ICUs and high-dependency units , " he said .
He said while it is the duty of doctors and health workers to fight this war , they need protection .
" The first and foremost being the PPE .
I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure continuous supply , we will lose this battle in the hospitals within ten days -- some doctors may die or resign from service as there is a psychological impact .
The PPE is of utmost importance for the delivery of healthcare services in this crisis , " he added .
On whether the locally-made PPE can work , Nayak said proper PPEs can not be replaced with unscientific clothing and instead of helping , such things can boomerang .
" Raincoat , polythene or fabric is not PPE .
PPE is scientifically designed and accredited .
If the doctors and other staff are made to wear the local ones , then it will be the government 's responsibility if someone gets infected or dies , " he said .
Asked if hospitals in Kashmir have enough ventilators , the DAK president said there are only 97 ventilators in the valley .
" The government has to purchase ( ventilators ) .
But there is a limiting factor , which is that if you purchase one lakh ventilators , then you need to have two lakh doctors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one driver .
You need drivers for the cars .
" Similarly , ventilators need doctors for them to be utilised round the clock .
We should not purchase so many ventilators that they lie in stores unutilised .
At this critical juncture , we have to utilise the limited resources in a proper way so that this battle is won , " he said .
A senior nurse at a super specialty hospital here , who declined to be identified , stressed on the need for a proper defence mechanism for healthcare workers against the invisible threat of coronavirus .
" Our hospital is a referral clinic .
We get patients from across the valley , including those who have a travel history .
We can not refuse treatment to anyone , but there should be a proper defence mechanism .
" We are given a tissue-gown , a simple mask and not N95 or triple-layer mask .
We share one sanitiser among 14 persons and it has to be used for a week before we get a refill on returning the empty bottle .
In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are dealing with , we are exposed , " she said .
A senior doctor at one of the designated coronavirus hospitals , who did not wish to be named , said lack of manpower poses the biggest challenge in the fight against coronavirus .
" We are facing a severe scarcity of staff because we are only a few doctors who are at the forefront .
If you see the other departments , for example we have anesthetics or even in the department of medicine , resident doctors and others are working .
They work for a day and get six days off , for anesthetics it can stretch up to 14 days , " he said .
" But those resident doctors or others who are working at the forefront and come in contact with COVID-19 patients have to work daily .
It is a health hazard .
If , God forbid , something happens to one of us , then the whole lot will be off for two-three weeks .
Then who will look after the patients ? " he asked .
The doctor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some people run away from hospitals .
Some may have genuine issues and some may not , but they are running away .
Some are roaming around in hospitals .
If any of them tests positive ( for coronavirus ) , then you can imagine how many could be infected , " he said , demanding proper security in hospitals .
Asked whether the doctors at the hospital have proper PPE and there is adequate supply , the doctor said , " As of now , we have adequate PPE .
" " I do not know what the position will be after 15 days , but right now we have adequate protection kits , " he said , adding that the available resources should be used judiciously .
Principal of Government Medical College , Srinagar , Dr Samia Rashid also said adequate PPEs are available .
" As of now , we have an adequate supply .
The government is providing supplies , " she said .
However , Rashid also rued the lack of manpower .
" We have to manage with whatever manpower we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has asked us to recruit people , but nobody is coming forward , " she said .
The number of coronavirus cases in India rose to 1,071 and the death toll climbed to 29 in India on Monday .
