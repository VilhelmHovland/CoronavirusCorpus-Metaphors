How Is The Justice System Responding To COVID-19 's Spread ?  NPR 's Rachel Martin talks to Keri Blakinger , who is a staff writer for The Marshall Project , about the conditions inside American prisons and jails as the coronavirus outbreak accelerates .
RACHEL MARTIN , HOST :  By now , we all know of the need to avoid crowded places and to practice social distancing , but there are some places and situations where that is basically impossible , like prisons or jails .
In New York City alone , at least 132 inmates and 104 staff members have tested positive .
Keri Blakinger is a reporter for The Marshall Project , and she covers conditions inside prisons and jails .
And she joins us on Skype .
Thanks so much for being with us .
KERI BLAKINGER : Hi .
Thanks for having me .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation inside correctional facilities across the country when it comes to COVID-19 .
What have you found ?  BLAKINGER : I mean , I think I found a lot of things that are not surprising to people that are covering and paying attention to what 's going on in prisons and jails .
And that 's simply that it 's just not a good situation .
Aside from the fact that social distancing is pretty much impossible , you have people coming in with high medical needs .
The medical treatment is not good , typically .
It 's really just sort of a recipe for disaster .
MARTIN : So what are these institutions doing ? I mean , what kind of measures , if any , are prisons and jails taking to stop the spread ?  BLAKINGER : Well , it varies a lot based on , you know , based on the facility and the prison system or the jail system .
They 're taking a lot of different approaches .
In some cases , they 're - they 've actually allowed things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places have allowed some of those sort of basic disease prevention measures that are typically not available to people in jails and prisons .
And then some places , I 'm still getting reports that people are not getting regular access to soap .
Some places have done things like suspend transfers into the facilities from , say , county jails to state prisons .
But then in other systems , I 'm still getting reports that they 're moving prisoners around within the system .
And some places have made moves to try to release people .
What that looks like turns out a little differently whether we 're talking about a jail or prison .
And then you 've got places like Texas , where the governor yesterday decided to start fighting efforts to release people in order to reduce the population and , hopefully , stop the spread of the disease behind bars .
MARTIN : Can you just explain ? The suggestion is , and what we 're seeing in some places happen , is that there 's an assessment happening of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this moment .
BLAKINGER : Yeah .
So in some of the county jails , there 's been discussion of releasing people who were detained pretrial .
That 's sort of the easiest population to look at because these are people that are accused and have not yet been convicted .
MARTIN : OK .
BLAKINGER : And in some cases , there 's discussion of releasing people that are convicted of , you know , low-level , nonviolent offenses and are being detained until they 're determined to be guilty or not .
On the other hand , on the other end of things , you have , you know , people in prisons who might be considered for compassionate release if they 're in vulnerable categories and , perhaps , nearing the end of their sentences .
BLAKINGER : I would imagine that things are going to end up worse in juvenile detention facilities .
But as of now , I mean , I think it 's a little hard to say .
We did have the first case here .
I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris County Juvenile Detention Center recently .
But , you know , I mean , kids are obviously going to , you know , be a little more difficult to get to practice some of the sort of , like , basic hygiene and social distancing that you might get adults to do .
But there 's also less oversight , in some sense , because so much information about youth who are detained is protected .
So it 's a little bit harder to know what 's going on there .
And I also think that reporters tend to pay a little less attention to it .
So you might see a lot of coverage of adult prisons and , you know , adult detention facilities , but juvenile justice tends to get a little less attention to begin with .
So I think for a few reasons , it 's going to be a lot harder to know what actually ends up happening in there .
And , you know , some of these places were really out of control to begin with before there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thank you so much for sharing your reporting with us .
