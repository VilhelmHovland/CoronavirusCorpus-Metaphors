Coronavirus Crisis Sure To Spawn New Political Realities  The social and political response to major catastrophes often proceeds in stages .
Stage 1 is denial .
Thankfully , this stage is largely over for the coronavirus crisis .
Not counting a few poltroons and conspiracy theorists , nobody is saying it 's all hype or no big deal .
Now we 're transitioning , in fits and starts , from Stage 2 to Stage 3 .
Politicians and policymakers are taking the threat seriously , but lacking contingency plans and the mental bandwidth to deal with all of the challenges that are arising , they 've been falling back on what they already believe to be true .
Stage 2 is the " COVID-19 confirms my priors " period .
For many Democrats , the roaring economy of eight weeks ago was the perfect time to push for canceling student debt , establishing a $15-per-hour minimum wage , implementing " Medicare for all , " etc .
A runaway pandemic and the start of a massive shutdown of the economy only made it more obvious that these " priors " were absolutely necessary .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect time to push for tax cuts , immigration restrictions ( including a border wall ) , a new cold war orientation toward China and a declaration of war on the media for being mean to the president .
And lo and behold , as the coronavirus crisis shaped up , they too believed their ideas were all the more justified .
Just because these policies are priors does n't mean they are necessarily ill-suited to the moment .
For instance , canceling some student debt makes more sense now than before , and a major rethinking of our economic entanglement with China seems acutely overdue .
But this has more to do with serendipity than critical thinking .
Sometimes we get stuck in Stage 2 .
Shortly after 9/11 , Sen .
Chuck Schumer ( D-N .
) bowed to Democratic form when he wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post arguing that the " era of a shrinking federal government is over .
" ( He called , familiarly , for a " new New Deal .
" ) George W .
Bush , who ran for president arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservative foreign policy establishment 's preference for regime change and nation-building , at least in part because it was the only fleshed-out program available .
Both priors prevailed , not to our particular benefit .
This is n't to say that both sides do n't try their best to deal with emergencies .
But just as the stockpile of masks and ventilators is not adequate for the sudden demand , the same holds for the storehouse of policies we could put into effect right now .
Or , to be more fair to the wonks who warned about some of these problems , there 's a lag time in getting new and better policies into production .
What Stage 3 of the coronavirus crisis will look like remains murky .
Andrew Yang 's quest for universal cash payments to Americans seemed quixotic just weeks ago .
Now it looks like the bedrock of a new policy agenda .
The traditional Republican resistance to interference in corporate decision-making is being worn away by the hour , and once swept aside it seems unlikely to return in nearly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that government should have a much bigger say in how supply chains are structured , regardless of the corporate bottom line .
It 's almost certain that the U .
pharmaceutical industry 's dependence on China for basic medicinal ingredients will not survive this pandemic .
Other responses are still in the early stages , and big questions will need to be addressed , from how we should deploy the Defense Production Act to how to reconcile our federalist structure with public health crises .
Perhaps oddly , I find myself wondering -- and worrying -- about Stage 4 .
How will things look when this is all over ? What will be the new normal ? Will the handshake ever return ? What emergency measures now will be our everyday reality years from now ?  Tax withholding was invented to collect revenue during World War II .
The imperial presidency , with its vast retinue of executive branch officials answerable directly to the presidency , was created to give Franklin D .
Roosevelt more power to fight the Great Depression .
This pandemic will no doubt have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of Anglosphere nations was a response to the crisis of the Plague .
( Historian Norman Cantor writes : " A barrister of 1350 deep frozen and thawed out today would need only a six-month refresher course at a first-rate American law school to practice property or real estate law today .
" )  One of my priors is the idea that our political parties are overdue for a major transformation .
The coalitions that constitute them are unstable and combustible .
The ideas that once bound them together are frayed .
This crisis will put even more strain on these already feeble institutions , as politicians are dragged out of their comfort zones .
It 's too soon to tell if this assessment will be confirmed , but I 'd take bets that after this is all over , political scientists , like so many others , will be writing about B .
and A .
-- before coronavirus and after .

Like all neocons , his ultimate loyalty is to the State -- not the American People -- which is what one can expect from a movement that views America as nothing more than a proposition nation versus as a People .
And , of course , a proposition nation is in no manner a " nation " -- or , if you prefer , a People -- but rather a geopolitical entity existing by happenstance .
