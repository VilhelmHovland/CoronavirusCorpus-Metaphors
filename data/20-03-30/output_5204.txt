Quarantine education  The outbreak of coronavirus and consequent shutdown of schools , work places , cities and even nations has raised questions on its impact on education across age groups .
Twenty nine countries have shut schools nation -- wide , an additional twenty have some form of closures .
With coronavirus griping the world more countries are likely to follow .
Due to the pandemic the International Baccalaureate ( IB ) has cancelled exams which will affect more than 200,000 students world over .
It 's impact on student learning is likely to be severe .
As has been established by research long breaks can have detrimental effect on learning outcomes .
In lots of instances around the world universities and senior schools have shifted to e - learning .
While e-learning has its merits and demerits , in times of emergency , it might be the only viable option for students to have continuous access to learning .
However , the needs of students can vary widely in terms of cognitive ability , interest , style of learning , and so on .
For the youngest learners , learning is a knowledge building process where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collaboration extremely valuable for socio -- cognitive development .
The challenges , therefore , in e-teaching at the primary level ( particularly children in the age group of three to seven ) are multifold .
First , in the event of a health emergency like an epidemic where learning is shifted to homes , parents might not be confident or adequately equipped to ' homeschool ' .
Well-meaning adults might end up relying on workbooks and worksheets that require a student to sit and repetitively complete these ( such as those containing alphabets , numbers and sums ) .
Second , while middle school , senior school and university students might be cognitively developed to rationalize e - classrooms , it would be difficult to engage younger ones with this mode of learning .
Unlike the older children , they do not usually communicate with peers via texts or phone .
In fact learning at this age happens through play and peer interactions .

In a study on early years pedagogy and implication of technology for children under five , Ioanna Palaiologou concluded that there is a need to reconceptualise young children 's learning patterns and reexamine the way in which the learning environment is organized .
Education researchers have increasingly made the case for adopting technology in everyday school curriculum .
Also , an EU funded project NIMIS ( Networked Interactive Media in Schools ) , explored the possibilities of using technology to enhance classroom based learning .
However , mass scale technology adoption is constrained by high cost and massive infrastructural requirement .
In times of crisis when the only option is to stay indoor , there usually is heavy reliance on technology .

Schools around the world are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , some schools are taking online lessons while some are setting tasks to complete and upload within a designated time frame ; some kindergarten teachers have read out stories online and uploaded them on websites .

Some schools are assigning online tasks even for the youngest .
On completion the tasks are shared by parents with the teacher virtually .
Shalini Advani , the director of Pathways School , Noida , one such school which has been trying to engage even its early years online , has explained the age group-related challenge : " Technology for the youngest functions differently --- it has to work in combination with parents and families .
For older children there is fair amount of synchronous learning .
It might be an interactive class but it is the teacher who is leading the class .
With the early years we expect that a lot of learning will be asynchronous .

The biggest challenge is how do you foster human relationship online in this time of offsite learning ? To overcome this challenge we are doing things like music lessons online where children can sing along .

Desperate times call for extraordinary measures - we need to dig into existing research and from it devise creative and democratic ways to constructively engage the young .
Keeping in mind the socio- economic disparities in India , we need to explore cost - effective ways of integrating technology with learning -- by using educational applications or forming class wise WhatsApp groups etc .
students can share videos or photo of the activity that teachers set out for them .
These activities can range from playing a game with parents ; creating something from mud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing a song ; or watching educational video , pretending to be their favorite characters ; virtual show and tell ; sending voice messages ; sharing handwritten ideas with friends ; sharing artworks ; and/or using the concept of collective storytelling to build a story that can be later enacted in school .
It is important to keep the young stimulated , engaged , curious and also virtually connected to peers beyond the boundaries of the classroom .
The foregoing clearly indicates how important it is for educational departments and institutions to formulate feasible learning methods for all age groups .
Finding cost effective and creative ways of engaging young minds will have positive implications moving forward .
Such measures can even be adapted in situations of emergency .
For instance , unscheduled school closures in times of conflict , natural disasters , or epidemics or even the annual feature of school closure in north India due to pollution spike .
The question no longer is whether or not technology is ' good ' for children but rather how can it be leveraged optimally for their socio-cognitive development .
