Peter Quartey Director for Institute of Statistical , Social and Economic Research(ISSER) says the panic buying that climaxed the President 's directive of a partial lockdown of Accra and Kumasi is clear evidence that many Ghanaians did not understand the directive .
Markets in Accra and Kumasi saw an increase in the numbers that trooped to purchase goods on Saturday and Sunday .
Even though the President announced that those in the food chain can operate , many still brushed off that directive and were at the market to buy goods needed to keep them alive for two weeks .
The panic buying also resulted in price hikes as prices of many goods were bloated .
Prof .
Quartey says this is a clear example that many Ghanaians need further education on the situation we find ourselves in .
" I do n't see why this panic buying happened , over the weekend , I experienced price hikes when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education on this lockdown because they seem not to really understand , I think the lack of information and understanding contributed to the panic buying " .
After the announcement of a partial Covid-19 lockdown in Accra , Kasoa , Tema and Kumasi which begun today , March 30 , 2020 , and will last for two weeks , most people rushed to the markets for some essentials products .
Within the two days window before the lockdown , there were long queues at markets and gas filling station with no respect to the social distancing protocol .
