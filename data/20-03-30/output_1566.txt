Rangers icon Barry Ferguson has given Douglas Park his seal of approval as the new interim-chairman steps up at Ibrox .
Park , the found of Park 's Motor Group , replaced Dave King after he announced his intention to immediately step down last week .
In his departing statement , King also admitted the club 's investment plans , exclusively revealed by Record Sport to involve Stuart Gibson , have also been shelved .
However , Ferguson insists he is no doubt that Park , who was part of the Three Bears movement that helped force out the previous Mike Ashley-backed regime in 2015 , can lead Rangers through troubled waters amid the COVID-19 crisis .
The Kelty Hearts manager said : " I was surprised that Dave King left in the midst of the coronavirus ( pandemic ) but what I will say is that the guy who has taken over from him , Douglas Park , I know him pretty well and he 's shrewd businessman .

" I know it will be a trying time but when I saw him being named chairman it settled the nerves a wee bit , knowing what type of businessman he is , knowing what type of guy he is .
I think Rangers will be fine and they 'll ride this storm out .
" He would n't take the job and would n't be writing cheques for the last couple of years if he did n't have the finances to put into the club .
" He is a wealthy , successful businessman .
" I know his businesses now will be taking a hit but I would think he would have a decent personal fortune to put into the team he has always supported .
" When I was playing he travelled everywhere to watch us with his two boys so I know how much of a Rangers fan he is .
