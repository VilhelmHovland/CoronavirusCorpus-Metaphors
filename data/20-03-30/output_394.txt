AP file photo  Business leaders in southern Maine have banded together with unusual speed to address the critical shortage of donated blood caused by the coronavirus outbreak .
Starting April 1 , " Distance Saves Lives " blood drives will be held each Wednesday for 10 consecutive weeks , in partnership with the American Red Cross and MaineHealth .
With unprecedented swiftness , the business leaders organized the plan in a two-day period .
The aggregate goal is to produce more than 1,000 pints of donated blood .
" We as a collective group have all been looking at ways to help the community , in particular the health care system , so this seems like a small thing that we can do that has a big impact on the ability to keep Mainers safe , " said Melissa Smith , the CEO of WEX , who led the campaign .
In the past two weeks , as the spread of the coronavirus has accelerated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56 in Maine , have been canceled , said Mary Brant , communications manager of biomedical services at American Red Cross of Maine .
That equates to 250,000 fewer donations , including 1,400 fewer in Maine , than would be expected .
The Red Cross needs to collect 13,000 donations every day to meet the national needs of hospitals .
Related  " The shortage is a severe shortage but what 's really remarkable is the way these businesses are coming together in such short order to say , ' What can we do ? ' " Brant said .
" Normally it takes many weeks to plan a blood drive .
This has come together in a matter of days .
"  Each of the 10 blood drives will be held on Wednesdays from 10 a .
to 4 p .
at the Portland Elks Lodge at 1945 Congress St .
Those wishing to give blood will need to make an appointment to help make sure all interactions maintain the appropriate socially distancing among donors , as recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
The goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The Distance Saves Lives blood drives will use added precautions to ensure the safety of the Red Cross staff and blood donors .
Social distancing will be enforced between donors during entry , donation and in refreshment areas .

All staff and donors will have their temperatures taken upon entering the building .
Hand sanitizers will be provided .
Tim Hayes , medical director of the blood bank at Maine Medical Center , said the current blood shortage is unlike anything he 's seen in his nearly 30 years working at the hospital .
Maine Med 's blood supplier is the American Red Cross .
The hospital 's standing order , received five to six days a week , accounts for over 90 percent of all the blood the hospital uses .
" We 've seen a cut on what we get in our standing order of 25 to 35 percent every day and we tend to use 100 percent of what we get , " Hayes said .

His company recently had to cancel its planned on-site blood drive because everyone was working from home .
" From the human aspect we 've had a lot of our employees asking , ' what can we do to help in this crisis , ' and giving blood , this is something most individuals can do , " Bourque said .
Smith , who oversees 1,500 WEX employees , said the CEOs need to take the lead in reassuring their employee base that making a blood donation is " safe and secure for them , " and that these blood drives will be conducted differently because of the virus outbreak .
" And we have to show up as well .
It 's not going to be just us telling people to do it .
We have to have senior management participating , " Smith said .
" I would n't do it if I felt it was putting my family at risk and at the same time , we have a need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donating blood , potentially puts your family at risk .
"  Maine Beer Company is one of the smallest companies in the campaign , with 75 employees .
" We 're all looking for some good that we can do , " said Steve Mills , the CEO of the Freeport-based craft brewery .
" There are so many things out of our control right now and the fact that we can give blood is in our control , and is a clear need , for us a it was a very clear ' yes ' to participate .
"  Hayes said the plan to hold weekly events and spreading out the donations is the best approach .
" Blood has a shelf life .
After six weeks it has to be thrown out , " he said .
" So there 's no sense in collecting it all now .
And the other problem is a donor ca n't donate again for another two months .
This way we can spread out the donations .
