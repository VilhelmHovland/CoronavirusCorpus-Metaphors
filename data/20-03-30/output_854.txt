Amid concerns that startups could be left out of COVID-19 bailout , investors step up lobbying  The massive bailout package that the U .
government passed last week to stave off an economic collapse from measures put in place to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic is giving out billions to American small businesses .
But startups that received venture capital money could be left out .
So the nation 's investment organizations and lobbying firms are stepping up their efforts to get clarification around the specifics of the loan programs established under the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act .
Their efforts could mean the difference between some of those billions in loans for small businesses going to startup companies or a whole swath of companies left falling through the cracks .
There appear to be two issues for startup entrepreneurs with the different types of loans that companies can receive .
The first is the " Affiliation Rules " that the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) uses to determine who is eligible for loans .
Under the rules , companies could be required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have backed as part of their employee count -- pushing the individual companies above the employee size threshold .
" Regardless of the purpose of these rules for traditional 7(a) loans , allowing the rules to exclude some of our country 's most innovative startups in this new loan program is manifestly contrary to the intent of the legislation : to help small businesses keep their lights on and their employees working despite the double financial squeeze created by the economic and financial market downturns , " according to a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza by the NVCA and other startup investment organizations .
" Without clear guidance enabling startups and small businesses supported by equity investment to access the loan facility , many of these startups may be rendered ineligible .
"  These issues around affiliation and 7(a) loans are n't the only ones with which startups may contend .
Startups could also be eligible for Economic Injury Disaster Loans ( EIDL ) .
These loans are part of a $10 billion program within the CARES Act that is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come with a personal guarantee if they 're over $200,000 .
And that requirement may be too onerous for startups .
EIDLs less than $200,000 do n't require a personal guarantee , nor do they require real estate as collateral , and will take a general security interest in business property , according to an article in Forbes .
Borrowers for EIDLs can take an emergency cash grant of $10,000 that can be forgiven if spent on things like paid leave , maintaining payroll , increased costs due to supply chain disruptions , mortgage or lease payments or repaying obligations that can not be met due to revenue loss , according to Forbes .
These loans apply to sole proprietors and independent contractors and employee stock ownership plans with fewer than 500 employees , Forbes wrote .
The emergency loans are available to companies that do n't qualify for additional funds -- and are based on self-certification and a basic credit score , Alex Contreras , director of Preparedness , Communication , &amp; Coordination at the Office of Disaster Assistance for the SBA told Forbes .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the lack of clarity around affiliation rules , Justin Field , NVCA 's senior vice president of government affairs , tells me .
" These rules will make it more difficult for small businesses with equity investors to even understand if they can access the program , " he says .
" It 's a tough situation .
If you have these non-bright-lined rules it 's going to be tough for anybody that has a company that has minority investors .
"  There could be significant implications for the U .
economy if these startups are ineligible for loans , the NVCA wrote .
Companies backed by venture investors are involved in the development of technologies of strategic interest to the U .
in the long term and are currently working on tools to diagnose , track , monitor and mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the short term .
" Bottom line : not providing this critical support to startups now will cause both short-term pain and long-term consequences that linger for years , " the organizations wrote .
" In 2019 alone , 2 .
million jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
According to the job site Indeed , 98 percent of firms have fewer than 100 employees and between small and medium sized companies , they jointly employ 55 percent of employees .
When implementing the CARES Act , we urge the SBA to issue guidance that makes clear affiliation rules do not arbitrarily exclude our most innovative startups .
