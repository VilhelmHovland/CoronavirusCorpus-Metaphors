Lloyds Banking Group ( LSE : LLOY ) has never been an appropriate pick for growth hunters .
Certainly not in a post-financial-crisis era of low central bank interest rates and profit-crushing misconduct penalties .
What it lacked in growth however , it more than made up for in dividends .
The fruits of huge restructuring , allied with the support offered by a resilient , strong economy gave it the financial firepower to increase annual dividends again and offer investors the chance to gobble up some truly handsome yields .
Global stock markets may be reeling from the coronavirus , but you do n't have to face this down market alone .

dividend yield for 2020 .
Is it too cheap to resist ?  Fear factor  I 've been fearful over the FTSE 100 firm since the fallout of the summer 2016 European Union referendum .
The prospect of a prolonged and painful withdrawal from the continental trading club promised massive short-to-medium-term profits turbulence for the likes of Lloyds .
It threatened to put the cosh on profitability over a longer time horizon too as Britain adjusted to Brexit .
I do n't think I was being overly bearish , either .
The steady stream of disappointing trading data from across the banking sector is proof of this .
But the economic turbulence caused by Brexit pales into insignificance compared to the damage that the coronavirus promises to wreak on Lloyds and its peers .
Certainly in the near term .
It threatens to rock the domestic economy like nothing any of us have likely seen in our lifetimes , as forecasts from the Centre for Economics and Business Research ( CEBR ) suggest .
The body predicts that a 0 .
dip in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a staggering 15% drop in the June quarter .
This would represent the sharpest decline since 1997 .
With consumer spending predicted to topple , unemployment rates set to boom and business investment tipped to dry up , the CEBR reckons that the UK economy will shrink by 4% over the whole of 2020 .
What should you do ?  City analysts do n't expect Lloyds and its progressive dividend to remain intact following the Covid-19 outbreak .
They reckon that the annual dividend will be hacked back to around 3p per share from 3 .
in 2019 .
But I worry that the banking colossus might be forced into even more swingeing cuts .
Firstly , that predicted payout is covered just 1 .
times by anticipated earnings , below the widely-regarded security benchmark of 2 times .
Lloyds likely wo n't have the balance sheet strength to make up for this shortfall either .
In October it axed its share buyback programme in response to ballooning PPI-related financial penalties .
The bank might have sailed through the worst of this particular saga , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause even more chaos for its capital-building plans .
As I said earlier though , Covid-19 is n't the only thing Lloyds investors need to contend with .
Brexit also casts a cloud over the bank and its ability to keep paying market-beating dividends .
So ignore that 9%+ dividend yield , I say .
