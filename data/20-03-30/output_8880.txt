Federal judges for now blocked Texas , Ohio and Alabama from curbing most abortions amid the new coronavirus pandemic , after the states recently cited the need to preserve medical equipment and public health as reasons to halt the procedure .
Governors across the country have ordered elective or nonessential medical procedures postponed to free up resources to devote to the fight against the coronavirus -- and some have included abortions in those categories .
Abortion providers are challenging restrictions in several states .
In addition to Monday 's court orders , cases also are pending in Iowa and Oklahoma .
Texas was an initial legal battleground , and U .
District Judge Lee Yeakel on Monday issued a temporary restraining order against the state .
Judge Yeakel wrote that delaying abortions causes irreparable harm because , as pregnancies progress , abortions become less safe and eventually illegal .
The judge , who was appointed by former GOP President George W .
Bush , added that the providers ' lawsuit is likely to be successful .
" The Supreme Court has spoken clearly , " Judge Yeakel wrote of a woman 's right to an early-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a procedure .
This court will not speculate on whether the Supreme Court included a silent ' **30;1789;TOOLONG clause .
' "  The judge is expected to consider a longer-term injunction on April 13 .
Texas vowed an immediate appeal .

Greg Abbott , a Republican , issued an executive order March 22 curtailing many medical procedures , and GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly followed up with a warning that only abortions necessary to save a mother 's life would be allowed .
District Judge Michael Barrett , another Bush appointee , on Monday said Ohio had n't yet shown that banning surgical abortions would save " any beneficial amount " of protective medical equipment for other uses .
In issuing his restraining order , the judge said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path of patients seeking pre-viability abortions , thus creating an undue burden on abortion access .
"  Mr .
Yost said he was considering the best next legal steps to preserve Ohio 's overriding interest " to save lives in light of the COVID-19 public health emergency .
"  The Alabama court 's action came Monday evening , with U .
District Judge Myron Thompson , a Jimmy Carter appointee , entering a restraining order for reasons similar to the other two judges .
Abortion-rights advocates applauded the rulings and accused states of attempting to advance antiabortion political goals during a public health crisis .
In the Texas case , the abortion providers ' request for a restraining order included a declaration from an unnamed North Texas college student who lost her job waiting tables due to the coronavirus shutdown shortly before she discovered she was pregnant .
Her abortion was canceled during the state-mandated waiting period between her appointments .
She had to have a friend drive her 12 hours to a clinic in Denver to get an abortion pill .
" Obviously , had this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveling during a pandemic , " the woman wrote .
" I was forced to drive across the country , to stop at dirty gas stations , to stay in an unfamiliar home , just to get health care .
I feel like Texas put me , and my best friend , in danger .
