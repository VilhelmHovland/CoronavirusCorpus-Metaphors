Franklin , AP  Arizona governor issues stay-at-home order effective Tuesday  1 / 5  Back to Gallery  PHOENIX ( AP ) -- Arizona Doug Ducey on Monday imposed a stay-at-home order to slow the spread of the new coronavirus that will take effect at the close of business on Tuesday .
But he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and restaurants will continue takeout service .
The order does n't prevent people from going to medical appointments or seeking other essential services from a long list he outlined last week .
He also discouraged hoarding .
" They will remain open , and everyone should continue to buy one week 's worth of groceries for one week 's worth of needs , " he said .
The governor said he took the action after the state 's top health official said it was necessary to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease caused by the virus .
Cara Christ , who oversees the Department of Health Services , said the rate of cases being seen in emergency rooms has been steadily rising from 2% to nearly 7% of all visits , and the percentage of positive tests had increased to about 6% of samples .
She said the rise triggered her recommendation for people to stay at home .
The governor said the order takes effect at 5 p .
Tuesday for all activity that is not essential , and he said people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want people to feel trapped or isolated in their homes , " he said .
" The weather is beautiful right now .
Find a way to get out and enjoy it -- with physical distancing .
"  Earlier Monday , the mayors of nine cities -- including Phoenix and Tucson -- sent a letter to Ducey imploring him to issue the stay-at-home order .
Ducey had for weeks resisted making such a call .
He prohibited mayors from forcing the closure of businesses on a lengthy list of enterprises deemed essential , from hospitals and grocery stores to golf courses and parks .
That order remains in effect , and businesses providing services on the list can remain open .
Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said on Twitter Ducey 's stay-at-home order is insufficient if he does n't narrow the list .
" Essential services .
are not golf and beauty salons , " Gallego wrote .
People caught violating the order could be charged with a misdemeanor , but only after police warn them and provide an opportunity to comply .
Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 230 million people live in states where governors have issued statewide shelter-in-place orders or asked people to stay at home .
In other states -- including Texas , Florida and Pennsylvania -- governors have resisted state-level proclamations or recommendations , but mayors and localities have acted .
State health officials said there have been more than 1,150 coronavirus cases and 20 deaths in Arizona .
Greenlee County , Arizona 's smallest , reported its first case , making it subject to Ducey 's orders for bars and gyms to close and restaurants to offer only takeout service in counties with cases of COVID-19 .
The restrictions now apply statewide with cases reported in all 15 counties .
The existing closures have left many unable to work .
Nearly 89,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week , up from 29,000 a week before and way up from about 3,500 a week before the health crisis .
The stay-at-home order came hours after Ducey and the state 's top school official said shuttered schools would remain closed for the rest of the school year .
The extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kathy Hoffman , means students will have to use online or alternative learning methods to close out the year .
The closure affects 1 .
million K-12 charter and traditional school students .
Private schools could re-open April 30 .
Before Monday 's extension , Arizona schools had been set to reopen on April 13 .
Ducey said he intentionally issued a stay-at-home order rather than calling for a shelter-in-place order to reduce fear .
" When you use words like ' shelter in place , ' that 's what happens during a nuclear attack , that 's what happens when there 's an active shooter , " Ducey said .
" We want people to stay at home .
It will have the same type of effect .
"  The school closure announcement hit some students hard .
" They were crying this morning when they found out , " said Beth Lewis , a fifth-grade teacher in the Tempe Elementary School District who has transitioned her class to online instruction .
Schools have been working to move teaching online or send packets home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections or computers .
Under emergency legislation signed by Ducey , schools are freed from classroom instruction and other requirements but required to educate students in other ways .
Hoffman 's spokesman , Richie Taylor , said some school districts are already offering online instruction while others are working to get homework packets to students .
Tucson Unified School District , for instance , told Hoffman 's office only half its 43,000 students have internet access .
State corrections officials have agreed with Arizona 's 15 sheriffs not to transfer convicted inmates from county jails to state prisons for 21 days , an effort to limit spread of the disease .
For most people , the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms , such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks .
For some , especially older adults and people with existing health problems , it can cause more severe illness , including pneumonia and death .
