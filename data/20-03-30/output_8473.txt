TOKYO -- Japan 's ruling party called for stimulus worth a total of 100 trillion yen ( $926 billion ) , or 16-17% of economic output , to combat the hit to the economy from the coronavirus , with the government set to sell bonds worth 16 trillion yen to help fund it .
Taking account of a package of measures compiled last December to ease the pain from the fallout of the Sino-U .
trade war , the combined size of the stimulus steps could top 100 trillion yen , Kishida said .
That would well exceed the size of a stimulus package Japan rolled out in the wake of the 2008/09 global financial crisis , which totalled 57 trillion yen with 16 trillion yen in spending .
" The size of the measures would reach 16-17% in terms of Japan 's GDP , bringing it on a par with U .
measures totalling $2 .
trillion , " Kishida told reporters .
To fund the package , Japan has no choice but to issue deficit-covering bonds , another lawmaker said , straining the industrial world 's heaviest debt burden that is already twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts in the national sales tax that went up to 10% last October , Kishida said that would be hard , citing the difficulty of returning the tax to the current level once it had been cut .
The ruling party would finalise the proposal on Tuesday for submission to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , he added .
Abe on Saturday ordered his cabinet to compile an unprecedented package of steps - including fiscal spending , monetary policy and tax measures - to support the world 's third-largest economy .
The government aims to craft an extra budget within 10 days , Abe said .
More than 662,700 people have been infected across the world and 30,751 have died from the virus , which has disrupted global trade , tourism and supply chains and prompted lockdowns , layoffs and bankruptcies in countries from Europe to North America .
In Japan , a recent jump in domestic coronavirus cases has stoked fears that Abe may declare a state of emergency , at a time a decision to postpone the Tokyo Olympics Games threatens to push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps will include arrangements allowing small and mid-sized companies to borrow at zero interest from private financial institutions .
It will also provide cash payouts to households and small firms that need it the most .
