Fear of price rises  The announcement triggered panic among many in Lagos , the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in the country which has so far infected 111 people and caused one death .
On Monday , residents in Lagos flooded markets and stores to buy food and other items .
Bose Odumosu , a mother of five , told Al Jazeera that she will use the next hours to stock up on food for her family .
" I was expecting the government to give us a few days to sort out our domestic needs before the announcement .

Every day , Akintan commutes to different locations in the megacity in search of a job and only gets paid when he is hired by building contractors for the day .
Now , the 56-year-old faces a two-week home quarantine without any income .
" Since January , I have not done much work so I have no savings .
I have been thinking of what to do with the little money I have for two weeks , " Akintan told Al Jazeera .

Nigeria is already feeling the pinch with oil prices plunging .
The country is the world 's eighth-largest oil exporter , and almost 90 percent of its export earnings are tied to oil .
Shutting down the country 's financial capital , Lagos , is expected to further add to an impending economic crisis .
" There will be a slowdown in the country 's GDP for the first quarter of the year , " Olaseinde said .
" You have five key states in the country essentially grounded .
That will lead to a loss of revenue for companies and individuals .
You could also see supply shocks .
"  Meanwhile , electricity remains a major challenge in the country .
Most people rely on costly diesel-powered generators to power their homes and keep businesses afloat .

" I hope they have factored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us can keep up with work at home , " he told Al Jazeera .

" With regular electricity , I can store my food and also keep my children entertained during the lockdown , " Odumosu said .
