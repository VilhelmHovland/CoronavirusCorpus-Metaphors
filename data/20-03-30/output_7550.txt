Mickey Welsh / Advertiser  For now , at least , the money will not go to expand voting options in the state , such as no-excuse absentee balloting .
But Secretary of State John Merrill on Monday did not prevent that from happening in the future .
" Today , this is the plan , " he said in a phone interview .
" If things change in Montgomery , it 's obvious some things are subject to change with the plan .
"  The plan at this point is to use an estimated $7 .
million -- $6 .
million from a federal coronavirus bill and $1 .
million in state matching funds -- to " reimburse counties for various preparation and election expenses , including , but not limited to , masks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and professional cleaning services to return the polling places back to their safe and sanitary pre-election condition .
"  " It is important that those at the state and local level are granted the flexibility to address the needs of their respective communities , " Merrill said in a statement .
" This funding will protect the health and safety of our voters , poll workers , and others involved in the electoral process .

$1 million will go to provide an additional $25 for poll workers on election day .
" This is just what we 've elected to do today , based on what we know today , " Merrill said in the interview .
The COVID-19 outbreak has slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections in the interest of public health .
By one estimate , 700 people enter a polling place on an average day .
The outbreak also raises concerns about the safety of poll workers , many of whom are senior citizens .
Those concerns have led to calls for expanded voting options to ensure public health and safety .
Alabama requires a valid excuse to vote absentee .
Democrats in Alabama have pushed for no-excuse absentee balloting and filed three bills in the House of Representatives to allow that to take place .
Republican legislative leaders last week seemed willing to explore those possibilities , though they were noncommittal .
It 's not clear how likely the passage of such a bill is .
The Alabama Legislature is not expected to return to business before April 28 .
Under the state Constitution , it must finish this year 's session by May 18 .
Legislative leaders have signaled their focus will be the state budgets and suggested other pieces of legislation may fall by the wayside .

Ivey and Merrill say that the outbreak is a valid excuse for voting absentee .
But Ivey suggested last week that further expanding voting options could increase the possibility of fraud .
That statement led to criticism from voting rights groups , who called such assertions a myth .
Caren Short , a senior staff attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center , said in a statement on Monday that Merrill needed to " anticipate the resources needed if most voters choose to vote by mail in November .
"  " An essential part of protecting the health and safety voters , poll workers , and everyone involved in the electoral process this year is for Secretary Merrill to work with the Legislature to implement no-excuse absentee voting , early voting , and curbside voting in Alabama so that the thousands of Alabama voters who do not want to vote at their polling location in November can have their votes counted , " the statement said .
The $2 .
trillion CARES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states to address election concerns arising from the coronavirus outbreak .
States can use the money " to increase the ability to vote by mail , expand early voting and online registration , and increase the safety of voting in-person by providing additional voting facilities and more poll workers .
