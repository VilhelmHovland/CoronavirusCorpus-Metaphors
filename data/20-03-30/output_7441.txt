Some Instacart , Amazon workers strike as jobs get riskier  SAN FRANCISCO - Some Instacart and Amazon warehouse workers walked off the job Monday demanding greater safeguards against the coronavirus , even as both companies are speed-hiring hundreds of thousands of new workers to handle a surge in delivery orders .
The one-day strikes had little impact on consumers , but the unrest called attention to mounting discontent among low-wage workers who are on the front lines of the pandemic , serving the needs of those who can keep safe working from home .
Whole Worker , a workers group for Whole Foods employees , is calling for a nationwide " sick out " on Wednesday .
Many workers in high demand are part-time or contracted employees , lacking in benefits such as paid sick time off or health care .
In addition to demands for more protection against coronavirus , workers are citing longstanding grievances over practices that keep wages low and part-time workers from getting more hours .

San Francisco-based Instacart said it is nearing its goal of hiring 300,000 more workers -- more than doubling its workforce -- to fulfill orders it says have surged by 150% over last year 's levels in the past weeks .
In the past week , Instacart said 250,000 people have signed up to work as full-service shoppers -- " gig " workers who make multiple trips a day to groceries stores to get and deliver groceries that people order on its app .

Several Amazon workers , meanwhile , walked out of an Amazon warehouse , in Staten Island , New York , on Monday demanding the facility be shut and cleaned during a paid time off after a co-worker tested positive for the virus .

Amazon is hiring 100,000 workers , a mix of full-time and part-time positions and include delivery drivers and warehouse workers .
Walmart , Dollar General and Pizza Hut and other companies are hiring thousands more , both to meet a surge in delivery order and more in-store demand for basics like cleaning supplies and toilet paper .
Andrew Challenger , a senior vice president of recruitment firm Challenger , Gray &amp; Christmas , said he expected a lot of competition for the new jobs despite the new risks from the pandemic .
