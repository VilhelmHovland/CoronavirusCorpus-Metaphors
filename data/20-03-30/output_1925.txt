FAQs - Coronavirus  We have closed our offices in London due to the progress of the coronavirus pandemic .
This means that we are not able to process , or return , identity documents that are sent to us as part of the licence application process .
Please DO NOT send us your identity documents , even if we have previously asked for them to support your licence application .
If you have already sent us your identity documents , we will return them as soon as we are able to re-open our offices .
We are still processing and issuing licences , and we are urgently working on ways in which we can progress all applications .
On Monday , 23 March the Prime Minister announced further instructions to the British public to combat the spread of Coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) .
His announcement can be viewed here .
It places further restrictions on when people can leave their homes and limits travel for work to essential roles only .
We can confirm that the current definition of critical worker DOES include regulated ( licence holding ) security professionals , essential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headings listed .
This status is only directly relevant to the ability to access the school and childcare systems at this time .
This critical worker definition does not affect whether or not you can travel to work - if you are not a critical worker , you may still travel to work where this absolutely can not be done from home .
To prioritise pressure on the schools system , it does NOT extend to all licence holders .
It is role dependent .
The list may change over time .
Government advice is to stay at home whenever possible .
It is to keep your children at home whenever possible -- even if you are a critical worker .
If , and only if , you are undertaking an essential role , supporting the nation 's COVID-19 response , which you can only do by accessing the school or childcare systems , should you do so as a critical worker .
This definition covers , amongst other areas , security provision in hospitals ; schools ; social care ; courts ; government estate ; supermarkets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure and utilities .
If you are providing essential security to a service which itself remains critical and functioning , which attracts critical worker status , then you are likely to be covered .
If in doubt , check with whoever contracts for your services .
Roles essential to supporting law and order , with the potential to reduce demand on policing , also meet the critical worker definition .
This would include , amongst other areas , the guarding of empty or closed commercial , retail or office premises ; the monitoring of similar through CCTV or other remote means ; and the provision of alarm response centres including mobile units .
If your role does not clearly fall under the headings above then you may still travel to work , if that work absolutely can not be done from home .
Your aim should be to stay at home whenever possible .
If this is not viable then assess whether you can deliver more services remotely e .
through CCTV .
If a physical presence is required then you should seek to minimise the number of staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is applied .
Note that in any circumstance , critical worker or otherwise , the Prime Minister has been very clear that ensuring social distancing remains the responsibility of the employer .
These are difficult questions in unprecedented times .
They are not easy and no-one else can answer them for you .
You will need to apply judgement , with the aim of minimising social contact where possible .
The words to focus on are ' necessary ' , ' critical ' and ' essential ' , otherwise please stay at home and minimise the transmission risks for the benefit of your health , your families , the general public and the NHS .
Guidance is only available for the current situation and , therefore , critical worker status only relates to accessing schools and childcare .
Updated guidance will be produced only in the event that more stringent rules , such as travel restrictions , are applied .
We can not speculate on this .
Public Space Surveillance ( CCTV ) : A Public Space Surveillance ( CCTV ) licence is required when manned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circuit television equipment to :  monitor the activities of a member of the public in a public or private place ; or  identify a particular person .
This includes the use of CCTV in these cases to record images that are viewed on non-CCTV equipment , but excludes the use of CCTV solely to identify a trespasser or protect property ( a security guarding licence would cover this activity ) .
Our enforcement approach takes into account a number of factors including whether an individual already holds a licence for another licensable sector , as well as any other factor that we think is relevant in the circumstances .
If you are looking to work in a sector with critical worker status and need to pursue your application , the Post Office SIA application service is widely available .
We are aware that a small number of Post Office branches have temporarily closed .
In order to find your nearest open branch and avoid unnecessary travel , please use the Post Office 's branch finder at https : **36;1575;TOOLONG .
**286;1613; Licensing requirements for security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on security are significantly reduced ( e .
door staff for pubs and clubs ) so it may be possible to use alternative sources for security staff .
When there is an expectation for an individual to respond to security tasks , whether urgent or not , they are likely to be a security operative and require a licence .
The PSIA does exclude persons undertaking other activities ( i .
not security operatives ) who respond to sudden or unexpected occurrences .
However , the circumstance of such an event would be for an individual or business to justify .
Our existing enforcement approach already allows for taking into account individual circumstances including , for example , the progress made towards getting or renewing a licence ; whether we are able to keep licensing functions operational and whether there is any build-up of applications ; availability of training ; and any other factor that we think is relevant in the circumstances .
Alongside this , we will be prioritising dealing with the activities and actions of those who might use the situation to abuse their position and/or trust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public .

However , in order to ensure that we can continue to operate as normal , we would urge you to avoid all unnecessary contact with us .

There are no delays to ' decision-ready ' applications - that is , applications that are at ' checks in progress ' and we have received all of the information we need in order to make a decision .
Our application process relies on us receiving information from a number of different organisations ( the post office , criminality disclosure bodies and so on ) .
It also relies on us receiving information from the applicant themselves .
If your application is at Next Steps or we require further information from anyone ( including you ) , then there may be a delay due to the closure of our office and a slowdown in the interfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documents to us but have not had them returned to you , and you have a copy or image of that document , please upload that to your licensing account as that may enable us to progress your application .
We are doing everything we can to progress your applications , and we will provide regular updates on our website as events unfold .
We remain committed to providing excellent service .

We will review each on a case by case basis , and make decisions based on the risks to the integrity of the scheme , and protection of the public .
We recognise the need to make decisions that are sympathetic with the current environment .
? Providing the approved contractor follows the DBS guidance on ID checking , and our systems can be adapted to trigger the move to checks in progress , then this may be possible .
We are looking into this .
