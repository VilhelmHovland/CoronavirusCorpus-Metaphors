I have spent over 40 years in the parks , recreation and conservation field , mostly in the public sector , but for the last 10 in not-for-profit advocacy .
One of the constants over this time has been the drumbeat by some decision makers that recreation and parks are " non-essential " services .
There are always more important funding priorities , like public safety , and parks budgets are seen as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given for taking funding from parks is that there are private recreation outlets , so why should the taxpayer pay for someone else 's recreation ? Until a crisis happens .
THEN everyone realizes how important the parks , open spaces and their crucial infrastructure and staff are to the public 's well-being and safety .
As the coronavirus has come to Westchester with a vengeance , the county 's parks and park facilities have increasingly come into focus .
Glen Island Park in New Rochelle has gained national attention as the location for a major drive-through testing facility in the most gravely affected area of our county .
The famed Westchester County Center in White Plains will serve as a temporary hospital .
The county 's parks , recreation and conservation staffs are playing a vital role in moving food and meals to places where people can get them safely .
One hundred years ago , ironically on the heels of the Spanish Flu pandemic , Westchester County 's leaders had the foresight to preserve large and small public open spaces , some 18,000 acres today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only have stood the test of time , but remain one of the best county park systems in the nation .
Thanks to this legacy , we now have them when we most need them .
These parks and park facilities are , in fact , demonstrating that they are " essential " -- to our health and safety .
We should n't be surprised if more of them are used depending on the length and severity of the coronavirus outbreak .
And beyond the specific virus-related uses for which the parks are being used , our parks serve a critically important function during this health crisis .
They are sanctuaries , healthy places where people can safely go and tend to their physical and mental well-being .
And thanks to the dedicated women and men who take care of our parks and serve the public every day , these places can be open and serve the public .
What could be more essential or fundamental than that ?  Buy Photo  New York State authorities are considering using the Westchester County Center in White Plains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in patients diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus in the coming weeks and months .
( Photo : Seth Harrison/The Journal News )  County Executive George Latimer and the County Board of Legislators know and believe this .
In fact , the county executive has strongly defended the importance of keeping our county parks open .
" We believe that people do need recreation right now , " he stated .
" They are in their homes , they 're not working , they 're not able to do other things .
They should be able to go outside .
That is what our park system is for as long as you do it intelligently and appropriately .
"  We appreciate the county executive 's thoughtful remarks and recognition of the unique role our parks play in people 's lives , especially now .
As we go forward , more than ever we will need the support and encouragement of our elected leaders , the parks department staff and the public to assure that we have adequate investment in our parks system and programs .
Clearly , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks are an " essential service .
"  At the Westchester Parks Foundation , we speak about the " power of parks .
" Parks have the power to transform lives , to save lives , and to heal lives .
Let us all stand together now , while we remember that parks are here for us when we need them and remind those decision-makers of the critical role that parks play in our lives .
Let us not forget , when this crisis passes and our lives may return to normalcy , that parks played a role in our healing .
We want parks to be there for us when we need them , and so we also stand up for parks and remember the importance of parks to our lives and the well-being of our community .
