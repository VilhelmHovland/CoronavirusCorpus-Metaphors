RORC cancels Cervantes Trophy , North Sea Race and Vice Admiral 's Cup  In line with the continued COVID-19 Government guidance , as well as advice from many of the host finishing clubs in Europe , the Royal Ocean Racing Club ( RORC ) has , with regret , had to cancel or change a number of its key events .
The Cervantes Trophy race from Cowes , Isle of Wight to Le Havre , France scheduled for May 8 has been cancelled .
Le Havre port remains closed and is unlikely to re-open until later in May or early June .
Members of the SRH ( Soci ? t ? des R ? gates du Havre ) and volunteers for this race have turned their attention to weekly Virtual Regatta inshore racing and drinks over their racing WhatsApp group ( Thursday nights for anyone interested ) .
RORC 's North Sea Race which starts from Royal Harwich Yacht Club and sails to the Dutch port of Scheveningen has also been cancelled .
The race - which was due to start on May 22- has traditionally joined forces with Scheveningen Yacht Club 's North Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate its 75th regatta anniversary .
Dutch authorities have currently closed the port , the club , and limited recreation activities until June 1 .
RORC has also elected to cancel the Vice Admiral 's Cup Regatta , scheduled for May 15 - 17 .
In recent years , this inshore regatta has enjoyed considerable growth and has become a ' must-do ' event for one-design and specialist classes .
With competitors needing to confirm details for the regatta , and with the RORC Cowes club house being closed in line with Government guidelines , it was felt prudent and in the interest of all parties to cancel the event early .
The RORC is especially sympathetic to the Royal Cork Yacht Club concerning their Tricentenary Celebrations in July .
The Cork Week Regatta , the IRC European Championships , and many other activities have all been cancelled .
The oldest yacht club in the world announced today that they took this difficult decision in conjunction with their partners to safeguard the health of sailors , visitors , volunteers and the community at large , and to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Cork in July .
RORC 's Morgan Cup race , scheduled for July 8 was to act as a feeder race for the Cork Tricentenary Celebrations , however due to the cancellation , the course will no longer head to Ireland .
At this stage there is no planned replacement course , but it likely to finish in the vicinity of the Solent .
RORC Racing Manager Chris Stone commented : " We are in extraordinary times and making these decisions , whilst unavoidable due to the Coronavirus pandemic , has still been very hard at the beginning of an exciting season of races .
There is a huge amount of planning that goes into every race we run , so we can sympathise with the Royal Cork Yacht Club who have been in the planning process for many years .
We will continue to monitor the pandemic and keep those who race with us fully informed in good time about the next races in the RORC Season 's Point Championship .
