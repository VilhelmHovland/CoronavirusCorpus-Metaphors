As the number of COVID-19 cases in Singapore approach 4-digit figures and the government implements stricter social distancing measures to combat the spread of the disease , more measures have been introduced to support those affected by the pandemic .
On the back of the Resilience Budget announced on Thursday ( 26 March ) , here are some key developments over the weekend .
Under the scheme , eligible SEPs will receive a total of S$9,000 in three quarterly cash payouts of S$3,000 each in May , July and October 2020 .
The SIRS is expected to benefit about 88,000 SEPs as a result of the broadened eligibility criteria .
Currently , about 50,000 SEPs receive Workfare payouts annually , and will be eligible for SIRS .
Due to the extraordinary circumstances brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic , the MOM has broadened the eligibility criteria beyond Workfare to enable more SEPs to qualify for SIRS .

For married Singaporean SEPs , the following additional criteria apply :  The individual and spouse together do not own two or more properties ; and  The Assessable Income of his/her spouse does not exceed $70,000 .
Singaporean SEPs aged 37 and over in 2020 who declared positive SEP income to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore ( IRAS ) / CPF Board ( CPFB ) for Work Year 2018 do not need to apply .
They will be automatically notified of their eligibility via letter and SMS , and will receive the first SIRS payout automatically in May 2020 .
Other eligible SEPs may apply for SIRS .
More details on SIRS and the application process will be released at a later date .
