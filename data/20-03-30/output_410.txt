The lesson of COVID-19 , influential politicians and commentators are claiming , is that the United States must delink itself from China .
" China unleashed this plague on the world , " Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas recently told Sean Hannity , " and China has to be held accountable .
" Cotton , who has proposed legislation to ban Americans from buying Chinese pharmaceuticals , is n't alone .
Representative Jim Banks of Indiana has urged Donald Trump to boost tariffs on Chinese products and put the money -- which he incorrectly thinks would come from Chinese exporters rather than American importers -- into a fund for Americans hurt by the coronavirus .
In a recent essay in The American Interest , the political scientist Andrew Michta used the virus to demand a " hard decoupling " from China .
Citing that essay approvingly , my Atlantic colleague Shadi Hamid recently argued , " After the crisis , whenever after is , the relationship with China can not and should not go back to normal .
"  These arguments are exactly backwards .
The relationship between America and China was not " normal " before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline has left Americans more vulnerable to the disease .
The lesson of this plague is n't that America should stop cooperating with China .
It 's that America must rebuild the public-health cooperation that the Trump administration helped destroy .
collaboration against infectious disease is n't a globalist fantasy .
It has proved immensely effective in the past .
And one of its greatest champions was George W .
Bush .
When SARS hit southern China in late 2002 , the Bush administration played a crucial role in Beijing 's response .
Deborah Seligsohn , a Villanova University political scientist who worked on science and health issues at the U .
embassy in Beijing from 2003 to 2007 , told me that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta sent 40 experts -- under the auspices of the World Health Organization -- to assist China in battling SARS .
" They provided the majority of the international advice in combatting the disease , " Seligsohn said .
The Americans helped their Chinese colleagues " create records , do contact tracing , do proper isolation -- all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , " turned out to be strikingly successful .
" SARS was largely contained to Asia .
Only 27 Americans were infected ; none died .
The SARS success story produced what the Brown University medical anthropologist Katherine Mason calls an " explosion of formal cooperation " between the United States and China in fighting infectious disease .
As Jennifer Huang Bouey of the Rand Corporation has documented , Bush 's secretary of health and human services visited Beijing in October 2003 and established a partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health .
In 2004 , the U .
and China began a collaboration " to build Chinese capacity in influenza surveillance , " as Bouey put it .
The number of U .
government employees working on public health in China grew dramatically , with some CDC officials even given offices inside their Chinese counterpart ( which , in homage to the American agency , is also called the CDC ) .
By Barack Obama 's second term , the United States and China were expanding this public-health cooperation to the rest of the world .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese personnel worked together at a Chinese-built laboratory in Sierra Leone and off-loaded supplies from a Chinese transport plane in Liberia .
As the Carter Center has noted , many of the health experts whom China dispatched to fight Ebola had been trained by the Americans whom the Bush administration had sent to Beijing a decade earlier .
Once again , these joint efforts saved lives .
From 2014 to 2016 , 28,000 people in West Africa contracted Ebola , far fewer than the 1 .
million the U .
CDC had predicted near the beginning of the outbreak .
In August 2014 , 40 percent of Americans told pollsters that they expected a " large outbreak " of Ebola in the United States .
Ultimately , only a single American died .
On Obama 's final trip to China in 2016 , the two governments agreed to jointly finance a headquarters for the African Union 's Centres for Disease Control and Prevention so that the continent could better fight infectious diseases itself .
The Trump administration is now trying to prevent that headquarters from being built .
That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public-health cooperation with Beijing .
In 2018 , The Washington Postreported that the Trump administration was " dramatically downsizing " the global " epidemic prevention activities " Obama had launched following the Ebola crisis .
This year , even as the coronavirus outbreak was raging , Trump proposed cutting American funding for WHO in half .
These cuts have taken a particular toll on American initiatives in China .
Since Trump took office , both the CDC and the National Institutes of Health have reduced their staff in Beijing .
The National Science Foundation has shut its office in the country entirely .
The sentiment inside the Trump administration , Bouey told me , is that " if you have collaborative research with Chinese scientists , you 're helping China to build their capacity , and that 's not good for the U .
, because China is a strategic competitor .
"  This hard decoupling on public-health matters almost certainly undermined the U .
government 's initial understanding of COVID-19 .
To be sure , Beijing responded to the outbreak with a disastrous cover-up , followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WHO delegation into Wuhan .
Nonetheless , academics who study U .
cooperation on public health told me that had experts from the CDC and the National Institutes of Health maintained close contact with their Chinese counterparts , those informal channels would have given the United States much better information in the virus 's early days .
" Five years earlier , " Bouey said , " CDC and NIH officials would have been on the ground in Wuhan .
" Seligsohn insisted that American officials during the Bush years " would have had a better sense of whether disease was being contained .
" Elanah Uretsky , a medical anthropologist at Brandeis University who focuses on China , suggested that " the cooperation on health projects between the U .
and China that existed before the Trump administration could have helped to pick up the virus sooner .
" This week , Reuters reported that among the positions the Trump administration defunded was that of a medical epidemiologist who had been embedded inside China 's CDC .
An American who previously occupied that role told the news service that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the world could have moved much faster .
"  Now that COVID-19 is sweeping across the United States , cooperation between Washington and Beijing remains essential .
" It 's hard to understate the importance of the U .
relationship in getting through this , " Tom Inglesby , the director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , told me .
Since China -- after its mistaken early attempts to suppress information -- has gotten the virus under control , Inglesby said , " we need to learn from them about what 's going to work .
Are they finding ways of returning to normal life without a vaccine ? What did China do in terms of social distancing that made the most difference ? We ca n't and should n't do what they did in terms of movement restrictions and compulsory action , but understanding what they did that we could emulate is very important .
" Jeremy Konyndyk , who led the Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance within the U .
Agency for International Development during Obama 's second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese doctors to every American city seriously affected by the coronavirus to explain how they managed COVID-19 cases .
In Italy , Chinese doctors are doing exactly that .
China is also sending large quantities of protective equipment to Europe now that its enormous manufacturing capacity no longer needs to be directed exclusively toward its own sick .
Beijing 's intentions are n't purely humanitarian , of course .
It 's not only donating supplies ; it 's selling them .
But less of that equipment is entering the United States because , as Chad Bown of the Peterson Institute for International Economics has documented , the Trump administration imposed tariffs on almost $5 billion worth of Chinese medical products .
The administration sheepishly lifted some of these tariffs when COVID-19 hit the United States .
But , Bown notes , " many critical medical products from China remain subject to tariffs .
" Plus , even the tariffs that have been suspended are set to return , thus making America an unreliable market .
Trump 's protectionism , Bown observes , " creates perverse incentives for Chinese medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  American doctors and nurses need masks , goggles , gloves , gowns , and thermometers now .
That Trump 's tariffs are already making these supplies harder to procure underscores the absurdity of Representative Banks 's call for hiking tariffs even higher in retaliation for the " China virus .
" Sure , the United States should , over time , boost its capacity to produce vital medical supplies .
But a hard decoupling in which keeping Americans healthy no longer depends on Chinese products and knowledge is a dangerous fantasy .
When I asked Brandeis 's Uretsky about Senator Cotton 's call for banning Americans from buying Chinese drugs , she noted that many of the drugs America already produces rely on Chinese raw materials .
Hard decouplers might also contemplate the possibility that Chinese scientists will create the first COVID-19 vaccine , as was the case with H7N9 in 2013 .
Konyndyk said it 's urgent that the U .
and China help forge an international agreement to ensure rules for coronavirus-vaccine distribution , no matter which country 's scientists first create it .
A world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ordinary Americans than a world in which countries hoard them .
But that requires cooperation between the United States and China , something Trump 's anti-Chinese insults make far harder .
With brutal force , COVID-19 is clarifying two realities that run directly counter to Trump 's worldview .
The first is that in a deeply interconnected world , the safety of ordinary Americans is often better protected by intensifying global cooperation than by buttressing national sovereignty .
Some elements of the U .
relationship are , indeed , zero-sum .
When China fortifies islands in the South China Sea , its regional power goes up ; America 's goes down .
But nothing China has done on Mischief Reef has ever tanked the U .
economy or forced millions of Americans to shelter in their homes .
It is now obvious that the two ways through which Chinese behavior most threatens ordinary Americans -- pandemics and climate change -- do not obey the zero-sum logic that Trump and his ideological allies favor .
The same virus that devastated Wuhan is now devastating New York .
The rising seas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's two superpowers is the logical response to these mammoth common threats .
And on infectious disease , we know that such collaboration works .
The second reality the coronavirus is laying bare is that the balance of knowledge and power in today 's globalized world has changed .
When SARS hit in 2003 , the United States was China 's tutor .
Now America 's doctors and scientists are desperate to learn how their Chinese counterparts vanquished the coronavirus in Wuhan .
If America 's factories were the arsenal of democracy during World War II , it is more and more clear that China 's factories will be the arsenal of global public health during the COVID-19 pandemic .
This shift would be jarring to any U .
president .
But it is particularly threatening to a president who flirts openly with white supremacy .
It 's not coincidental that the White House has become a geyser of anti-Chinese bigotry at the very moment America needs China most .
Trump 's rhetoric reflects an inability to cope with a geopolitical transition that , to his supporters , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of them elected Trump to prevent .
The lesson of this plague is not only that the United States must cooperate more deeply with China .
It is also that the United States will be less able than in the past to dictate the terms on which that cooperation occurs .
Trump , Cotton , and other hard decouplers may find these realities excruciating .
But the more they resist them , the more Americans will die .
