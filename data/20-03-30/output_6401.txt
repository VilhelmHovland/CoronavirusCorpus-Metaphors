Mark Zuckerberg , signaling his personal involvement in a new Facebook commitment of $100 million to bolstering local journalism , told me that " very local work " is vital to his big mission of bringing the world closer together .
What he 's saying : " Everyone believes that local journalism is incredibly important , " Zuckerberg told Axios in a phone interview .
" But everyone is connected to their local outlets .
Figuring out how to make an impact , and support local journalism broadly and at scale , has been a challenge .
"  " We know that a lot of journalists are working really hard under very difficult conditions , when getting accurate information is incredibly important , " Zuckerberg continued .
" At the same time , a lot of these organizations are struggling because of the economic impact of the outbreak .
"  Facebook'sannouncement is a much-needed cash infusion for local news businesses , which are having their business models annihilated by the coronavirus crisis , at the same time readers need them more than ever , Axios ' Sara Fischer writes .
$25 million will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
The other $75 million is being funneled to news organizations in need globally through Facebook marketing , or ad space Facebook is purchasing to market itself from those outlets .
" Over time , we think this work can have the added benefit of fostering civic engagement , which research suggests is directly correlated with people 's reading of local news .
"  What 's next : With Facebook experiencing a massive surge in traffic , Zuckerberg said the company is moving up products on its long-term road map that 'll help people maintain their social infrastructure while they ca n't go outside -- video and group chat improvements , and online events instead of physical events .
