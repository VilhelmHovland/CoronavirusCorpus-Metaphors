At a press conference , FDA director general Eric Domingo said the agency has decided to use " these point-of-care test kits ( which ) are registered for use in countries with reliable regulatory agencies such as China and Singapore .
"  MANILA , Philippines -- The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) announced yesterday the approval of the use of five rapid antibody test kits for coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) .
At a press conference , FDA director general Eric Domingo said the agency has decided to use " these point-of-care test kits ( which ) are registered for use in countries with reliable regulatory agencies such as China and Singapore .
"  " We approve kits that are registered and used in countries with advanced technology and wide experience with COVID-19 .
We want the people to have access to testing but , of course , proper evaluation and safeguards will still be in place , " Domingo said .
The FDA , along with the Department of Health , was reluctant to allow the use of rapid antibody test kits in the Philippines but was apparently pressured into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the kits .
Domingo disclosed that the FDA has also approved the SARS CoV2 kit by Gene Xpert from Abbott Laboratories , which can detect the virus within five minutes .
Abbott Laboratories said it won US marketing approval for a diagnostic test for the coronavirus that can deliver results to patients within minutes and be used in physicians ' offices and urgent care clinics , as well as hospitals .
Abbott said in a statement that it plans to begin distributing the test next week and will ramp up manufacturing to 50,000 tests per day  This brings to 17 the total approved " PCR-based test kits for commercial use " in the country .
PCR or polymerase chain reaction is a process of sequencing DNA to detect the presence or absence of a pathogen during infection .
The processing is done in a laboratory using a machine .
Domingo , however , underscored that while they gave the green light to the five testing kits , the FDA requires that the " product inserts or label of the Rapid Test Kits " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  This insert shall state that the " product is strictly for medical professional use only and not intended for personal use and that the administration of the test and interpretation of results should be done by a trained health professional .
"  Domingo added the results may yield false negative or false positive so confirmatory test using PCR would be required .
" We have to be very cautious in using these rapid test kits because they measure antibodies and not the viral load itself .
The body takes time to develop antibodies and this might give a negative result for patients who have been infected but antibodies have not yet developed , " he said .
On the other hand , there can be a false positive result due to " cross reaction with other bacteria or viruses , thus requiring confirmatory PCR-based test .
"  This happens when the rapid test kit detects an antibody that has been acquired by a patient from previous infections with a bacteria or virus other than SARS-CoV2 .
" In simple words , the test kits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily generated by the coronavirus that caused COVID-19 but other virus or bacteria , " he added .
Domingo maintained that while rapid antibody test kits will yield faster results compared to the PCR-based kits , " it is important that a trained health professional will evaluate and interpret the results .
"  Aside from this , instructions about the handling and disposal of the specimens , as well as the required temperature and proper used must be strictly followed to generate accurate results .
The FDA is also calling on local government chief executives , heads of agencies , hospitals and private companies to be cautious in using these test kits .
The agency also asked doctors to help in testing and guide patients in the interpretation of results .
Domingo said the DOH " remains steadfast in its obligation to protect the public .
by ensuring that health commodities , especially those related to addressing the COVID 19 emergency , are certified following regulatory standards -- through streamlined processes .
"  " Let us remain vigilant and hopeful as we protect each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this vulnerable situation .
During this rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in the country , the agency continues to serve the people by giving them access to testing without compromising our mandate of ensuring the safety , efficacy and quality of every health product for the public , " he added .
' Do rapid testing now '  Meanwhile , presidential adviser on entrepreneurship Joey Concepcion yesterday urged the government to do the rapid testing as soon as possible to fight COVID-19 and help prevent another lockdown from happening in the country .
" To win this war , we have to have a clearer view of the COVID-19 .
We can not emphasize enough ; it is critical that we do rapid testing now , " Concepcion said in a statement sent to The STAR .
Last week , more than 30 business leaders and heads of chambers met to discuss the sector 's proposal to curb the pandemic and address the current crisis .
One of the key approaches discussed , Concepcion said , was the use of rapid testing kits .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will soon discuss the proper distribution and testing of communities .
Hopefully , this rapid testing will help prevent another lockdown from happening , " he said .
After securing the testing kits and determining who has been infected or not , the next step is to ensure a " reset " to help save lives and give a clearer picture of the enemy and how to stop it , he added .
" By ensuring continued testing and the gathering of more data , the government can develop a more strategic and comprehensive mitigation plan .
Through this , we can also better help our frontliners -- most especially doctors and nurses who are manning the hospitals -- as well as micro , small and medium enterprises .
Once public confidence is reinstated , the Filipino working class can get back to their jobs at the soonest possible time and revive the economy , " Concepcion said .
As of date , the government has ramped up its testing at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine , from 300 tests per day to almost 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key facilities such as St .
Luke 's Quezon City and BGC and the Lung Center of the Philippines .
He commended the " untiring efforts " of the government , led by Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles , FDA 's Domingo , Inter-Agency Task Force chief Carlito Galvez Jr .
and Health Secretary Francisco Duque in fast-tracking the approval of rapid test kits used by other countries in effectively and successfully combatting COVID-19 .
The presence of Chinese vessels near Pag-asa Island , a fifth-class island town of Palawan located in the disputed Spratlys Island chain in the South China Sea , is not new to the Department of National Defense .
