Social Navigation  I have come to realize there is never enough M&amp;Ms in the store-bought trail mix I have been buying .
How do I remedy that ? Is it time for me to go back to buying all the ingredients separately and making my own ? Or should I be checking out other stores for help ? If anyone has any solutions , tag me with your suggestions on Twitter .
( Michael : Same problem , but mine is exacerbated by a wife who just literally picks the M&amp;Ms out to eat them .
like some sort of maniac ) .
This thread popped up on my timeline late last night and I was immediately enthralled :  Gosh , I sure hope Matt Nagy has a burner account and was taking notes .
" 52 All Go Special X Shallow Cross .

And why ca n't David Montgomery or Tarik Cohen play the Alvin Kamara role in Payton 's " 52 Nudge Ole ' HB Choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy enough to work : Borrow Payton 's plays , give them to Nick Foles , and have him throw for 4,000+ yards and post an almost 6-to-1 **25;178;TOOLONG ratio .
Heck , maybe that 's not all that crazy .
analyst David Carr dropped a wild prediction for the Bears ' newest quarterback , projecting a 4,000-yard , 28-touchdown , 5-interception season .
I do n't hate Carr 's logic when he writes : " I realize Foles is coming off an injury-abbreviated nightmare year with the Jaguars , but that 's a thing of the past .
In Chicago , he will have better offensive weapons and a ferocious defense that will routinely provide good field position .
" That was the key to success for the Bears offense in 2018 .
They were n't dominating the field of position battle as much in 2019 , but when they were on the right side of things , the offense did n't take advantage of it .
I love the angle here from Jeff Hughes of Da Bears Blog .
The headline says it all : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
And you 'll get no argument from me .
There is something about an offensive lineman who plays with a real edge that tends to get the job done .
I think of guys like Olin Kreutz when I think of pissed off offensive linemen .
Visions of maulers bullying defensive linemen -- who are equal in size -- and bruising them in the rush attack .
The Bears need some attitude on that line .
They need to get ugly .
And they need to do it in the draft , if only because the cap ramifications of paying all the offensive linemen means other positions will have to be filled with players on rookie-scale deals .
On the other side of the ledger , laughter is needed in my life these days :  Brock Olivo , a former special teams assistant with the #Bears , has been quarantined in Rome .
