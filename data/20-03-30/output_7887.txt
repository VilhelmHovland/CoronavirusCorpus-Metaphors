Trump says , " Challenging times are ahead for the next 30 days , " and he says refraining from public outings is " our shared patriotic duty " during the outbreak .
The comments come a day after Trump made a dramatic course reversal and announced he would not be moving to ease the guidelines and get the economy back up and running by Easter , as he said last week he hoped to do .
