But as a call-in guest on The Pat McAfee Show on Friday , Rodgers described his group 's successful efforts to leave the country before the borders closed as " quite the ordeal , " adding that " there was definitely a panic in the air .
"  Trying to explain the scene at the airport , Rodgers referenced the movie Argo , asking McAfee and co-host ( and Rodgers ' former teammate ) A .
Hawk if they had seen it before .
Rodgers explained :  " The scene at the end where they 're racing to the airport .
