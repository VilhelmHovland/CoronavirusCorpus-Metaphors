When COVID-19 ( coronavirus ) first made headlines , in China , then worldwide , global market reactions were complacent .
It was perceived as a primarily Chinese issue , reminiscent of the SARS outbreak of the early 2000s .
Expectations were for a brief selloff , which would last only until the number of new cases retreated .
However , the virus has spread far beyond Chinese borders and erupted into a global pandemic .
Global economic expectations changed dramatically in early March , and have continued to evolve just about daily since .
Global growth forecasts for this year are likely to reach 40-year lows .
It 's uncertain what lies ahead , but COVID-19 is sure to dominate headlines in the near term , and it presents two big issues for markets .
The first is on the demand side .
As a result of the sudden decline in economic activity , many companies will experience unprecedented declines in revenue .
It is unlikely that many companies will be able to adjust cost bases quickly enough to this decline , so we are likely to see increased pressure on balance sheets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for small- and medium-sized businesses .
These enterprises tend to have less-diverse revenue streams , are more consumption driven , and have less access to financing .
The second issue markets are facing is liquidity .
These concerns manifest in two ways : market liquidity and company liquidity .
The former is an issue because as markets fall , financial conditions tighten .
This , in turn , drives markets even lower .
The latter is problematic because as companies ' cash flows fall , the probability of credit defaults increase , which could threaten the economy at large .
If companies go bankrupt , there will be labor shedding and people leaving the workforce , which would be a greater structural threat to the economy than just the current demand for liquidity .
These issues play out in an environment where oil markets are reeling after having received a dual shock .
There has been a decline in demand due to the rapid slowdown in economic activity .
There has also been a supply-side shock , driven by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain and investment , which will have economic consequences that could be compounded by the coronavirus situation .
Government action will serve as the nuts and bolts for building a barricade against these more serious structural issues .
Thus far , central banks have responded by lowering rates and pumping liquidity into markets .
Whilst this is an important step , we are still awaiting more fiscal-policy action , which may inspire enough confidence to stabilize markets .
However , a lasting recovery will also depend on confidence that the rate of spread of the virus has been contained .
We may not be able to divine the full future economic effects of COVID-19 , but we can look to history as a guide .
In China , as a result of containment measures against the virus , industrial production experienced its steepest decline ever ( even compared to the global financial crisis ) .
This suggests that economic data around the world will continue to be grim -- for now , at least .
If we look further back , however , it 's clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up cycles , in both EMs and the U .

The index is computed using the net return , which withholds applicable taxes for non-resident investors .
The more governments are able to prevent demand-side problems and liquidity concerns from evolving into structural issues , the better the chance for a strong earnings recovery .
All of this also hinges on how quickly coronavirus cases peak .
Right now , it 's unclear as to whether the pandemic will continue in waves over a prolonged time , or be stemmed by summer 2020 .
In Hubei , the Chinese province where the virus originated , cases peaked in early March , about 6 weeks after the initial surge .
While this may offer some guidance , the Chinese government has farther-reaching powers than many other states , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We expect that other nations will require longer lockdown periods because they can not be as stringent .
Because recovery depends on containment , we believe economies will experience a U-shaped recovery once measures are relaxed .
In emerging markets , the call for liquidity is being answered , which is promising .
Additionally , emerging market balance sheets entered this crisis period in a healthy state , which may bode well for recovery .
Reform agendas , especially in Brazil , also offer encouragement .
While this market rout appears , in many ways , similar to 2008 , volatility may present an opportunity for long-term investors to initiate positions in high-quality companies with good valuations that can benefit from these market conditions .
