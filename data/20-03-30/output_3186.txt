Co-parenting in the COVID-19 crisis  Lisa and Spencer Rufiange are navigating the COVID-19 pandemic as a team .
They are separated but remain close as co-parents of their 10-year-old daughter , Madison .
" I 've often joked -- half joked -- that he 's a better father than I am a mother , " Lisa Rufiange said .
" He always has her best interests in mind and I think during this particular time , it 's a time to become more cooperative and more fluid , not less .
"  Often that is easier said than done .
For some Canadians , the fallout of the pandemic -- job loss , school closures , financial strain ( to name a few ) -- has amplified already difficult family circumstances .
" The people who had sort of healthy functioning co-parenting relationships before this , for the most part , are finding that they 're feeling kind of pulled together in this , " said psychologist Vanessa Lapointe .
" They are able to kind of stay the course and continue on with the dynamic of the relationship .
" But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets tough , whatever dynamic that 's playing out in your relationship , it 's going to become really , really heightened .
" And so , if it was challenging before now , it has suddenly become very , very challenging .
"  According to a communications adviser from Alberta Justice , all court orders regarding child custody remain in effect .
The province 's chief medical officer of health Dr .
Deena Hinshaw also clarified that current restrictions do not mean " parents or children would need to choose which household they stay in .
"  She added that parents should do their best to contain the number of people their families are in contact with .
Establish a family plan  Karen Stewart , founder of Fairway Divorce Solutions , advises co-parents to come up with a family plan of steps they will take to keep their children physically and emotionally healthy during the COVID-19 crisis .
" Sit down with a piece of paper and pen and write out , ' How are we going to handle this ? ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in a planning mode versus a reactive , short-term mode .
" Write 10 things we are going to do as a family .
The number one thing that needs to be on there is obviously the protection of the kids .
"  Nail down off-limit conversations  After ensuring children 's physical safety is looked after , Stewart advises mapping out how to protect their emotional health .
One way is to put all conversations that lead to heated arguments or stress on hold .
" We 're not going to talk about the future financial situation .
We 're not going to talk about long-term custody arrangements , " Stewart said .
" We are going to deal with this short term .
So there should be some conversations that are taken off the table until this is done .
If you 're dealing with lawyers , put them at bay .
"  Step into your co-parent 's shoes  Lapointe says co-parents can defuse arguments by taking a step back to try to understand how their co-parent is feeling and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parent refuses to send the children back because they feel their counterpart is n't taking enough steps to make sure they stay healthy , the other parent should consider what 's at the root of their anxiety .
" Rather than going to , ' You ca n't keep my kids from me ! You 're being unreasonable in all of this ! ' Go to , ' Oh .
I wonder what 's up for them ? I wonder if they are really scared and controlling things in this way is allowing them to feel more settled in this .
' And just hear them in that , " Lapointe said .
" ' You are such a good mom/dad .
I really appreciate how much you are thinking through this for our children .
' "  Lapointe says that does n't mean handing over the children for the next three months , but it means listening instead of immediately trying to overpower them in their concern .
See the opportunity  Lapointe considers the pandemic an opportunity to potentially reset relationships that are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parents , so finding a healthy co-parenting dynamic is vital to their emotional well-being .
" Think about that during a time when we have this virus that is COVID-19 all around us and now you 're going to let this virus that is the toxicity of your co-parenting relationship further infect your children because they will be at the effect of that .
And so this is an invitation guys , " Lapointe said .
" It 's an invitation to stand up , step in , to work on yourself so that you can change the way you are looking at things and then to find a way from that very adult , very present , very emotionally grounded place and space to navigate this bumpy terrain with your co-parent .
"  Lisa and Spencer Rufiange have been " happily " separated for eight years .
The pandemic has pushed them to work even more creatively together as Lisa assumes the role of Madison 's Grade 5 teacher for the foreseeable future .
Their advice for co-parents is be present and focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  " Deal with the differences later .
Just work on the co-parenting aspect .
Deal with the situation we 're in right now .
