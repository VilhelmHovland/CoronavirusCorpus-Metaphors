Since then , as in the rest of the state , the clergy have focused on online services .
Sunday 's service had an audience of 6000 , and daily intercessions online are attracting congregations of more than one hundred .
Canon Turner , a former Canon of Exeter Cathedral , reported at the weekend : " Prayer and intercessions are still seen as an essential , and many churches also run large social programmes that people rely on .
