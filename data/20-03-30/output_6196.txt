Central Coast have become the second A-League club confirmed to stand down players and staff as the financial pitch of the coronavirus pandemic hits .
UpdatedUpdated 5 hours ago  Share  Professional Footballers Australia ( PFA ) announced on Tuesday they had received confirmation from Mariners players that they had received stand down notices .
The Mariners decision comes after Perth Glory owner Tony Sage took similar steps last weekend - and then predicted all other clubs would follow suit .
Just like they did with Sage , the PFA have issued Mariners owner Mike Charlesworth with a letter of demand seeking the immediate reinstatement of players .
" These actions undermine attempts for our game to overcome common challenges , fight for common interests and re-establish our sport , " PFA chief executive John Didulica said .
" While other codes have fostered unity and demonstrated leadership amid crisis , we are at risk of regressing to the lowest common denominator .
"  AAP understands Brisbane Roar players and staff have also been stood down amid concerns a $900,000 quarterly payment to clubs by broadcaster Foxtel will not be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
FFA officials are reportedly starting the hunt for a new broadcaster with concerns growing that Fox Sports will walk out on its $57 million-a-year deal .
Didulica said his organisation had written to FFA to ask that they follow the lead of other sporting codes in this country and find a collective and uniform solution for the sport .
Despite the concerns , Sydney FC chief executive Danny Townsend is optimistic professional football will continue in Australia after the outbreak and its subsequent restrictions have passed .
The Sky Blues have placed all non-essential staff on paid leave until the end of April but Townsend admits the club will have to assess their position if the postponement drags on .
" Football in this country has come a long way and we 're not going to let this situation unsettle that , " Townsend said  " Obviously it 's going to have an impact and what we look like coming out of this is probably different to what we look like going into it .
" That 's probably every business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professional football will remain as it were before and we 'll just have to adapt with the necessary financial impacts that will come down the line .
