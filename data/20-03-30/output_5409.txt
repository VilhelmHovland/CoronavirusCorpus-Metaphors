Hyderabad : Discrimination and mocking has never been new to the people of north-eastern states and the transgender community living in the city .
The locals and students of the north-east states are being mocked with names such as ' Corona ' and ' Virus .
'  Speaking to THI , Elsie L'hous , an MNC employee in Madhapur and native of Mizoram , said , " The mongoloid features I have are alarmingly unwelcoming now .
It always was unwelcoming and it will be .
I go through the plight of bearing suspicious looks while purchasing antibiotics and medicines for my sinusitis as I look Chinese .
People need to understand that we just have few features as the people of China and that does n't mean we are here to spread the virus .
"  " A few days back , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a few men were staring at me as if I was a germ or something worse than that .
Then later , they started seeing me and made some vulgar expressions and made a comment saying ' Mask lagao Corona failega .
' This was very disturbing for me for sure , " said a student of Wesley Degree college , Secunderabad , who did not want to be named .
He is a native of Tripura .
While the COVID-19 has become a reason for the north-east locals of the city to be mocked , the transgender community has also become a target of ridicule .
Some unknown miscreants have put up some transphobic posters at Ameerpet Metro Station on Sunday .
The issue was highlighted when Meera Sanghamitra , transgender rights activist from Telangana and National Convenor of National Alliance of People 's Movements ( NAPM ) , tweeted about the issue and requested the Hyderabad police to take action against such miscreants .
The poster written in Telugu reads , ' Warning : Do not allow Kojja , Hijras near the shops .
If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be infected with Coronavirus .
Beat and drive them away or call 100 immediately .
Save people from Corona Virus Hijras .
