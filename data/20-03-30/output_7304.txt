Home Quarantine Rollercoaster Ride  Info from Licensor : " Being told to stay home during the COVID-19 quarantine , we were trying to come up with inventive ways to entertain the children .
Not being able to go to the park , we had to bring the park into the home .
Having a nice big projector screen , and an old laundry basket , it was the perfect combination to make an in-home rollercoaster ride .
Our 3-year-old daughter loved it and is always asking to try new rides .
