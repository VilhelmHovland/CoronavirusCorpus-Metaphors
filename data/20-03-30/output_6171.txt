Naturally , fans online were quick to come up with ideas on how to bring back the footy spirit .
As a regular at my hometown local footy , I am a firm believer that there is simply no reason to attend a game if you ca n't beep your horn when somebody kicks a goal .
to create atmosphere should drive in a few utes around the boundary like country footy and beep the horns when a goal is kicked #AFLTigersBlues  The whole game seems like a bad idea for social distancing measures .
I 'm not certain whether the players were tested or not , but I can confirm at least one player licked his own hands , which seems like a surefire way to spread something .
The commentators talking about disinfecting the ball while a player kicked licks hands ahead of the centre bounce .
Amazing .
