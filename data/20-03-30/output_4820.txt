Four medical journalists from Western Australia have come together to create a campaign aimed at supporting Australian health workers through the coronavirus pandemic in the simplest way possible : with a hot cup of coffee .
Kristen Watts , Marnie McKimmie , Cathy O'Leary and Peta Rasdien established Fuelling the Frontline in the hopes of brightening the long and stressful shifts medical staff around Australia are working in the face of COVID-19 .

" The community is very grateful for the sacrifices these people are making to keep the rest of us standing , " Kristen tells 9Honey .
Medical journalists with more than 25 years of experience each , she and Marnie , Peta and Cathy have seen first hand how the pandemic has impacted Australian health workers and knew they had to help .
" They 've helped us and now it 's our turn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff assist people lining up for COVID-19 screening outside the Royal Melbourne Hospital on March 11 , 2020 in Melbourne .

" We heard people were making care packages or trying to donate coffee machines and that poses all sorts of problems for hospitals , " she explains .
" On the other hand , we know health workers are fighting the good fight and we know how much a single coffee can mean to them .
So it 's been amazing to connect the two .
"  The cost of a cup of coffee is something most Aussies can manage , even in these uncertain times , and improving morale among healthcare workers is more important now than ever before .
However , if funds for medical staff are more urgently needed elsewhere in the future , Fuelling the Frontline can also divert money there .
Donations to the campaign are being managed by the Australian Medical Association to ensure the process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical staff on the frontlines .
And individual Aussies are n't the only ones getting on board : large and small businesses have reached out to offer financial donations or in-kind support , helping the project reach more medical workers .
" It is going to cost a lot of money to serve up coffee each week so every cent counts , " Kristen says .
As coronavirus cases continue to grow in Australia , the pressure on health workers will only continue to grow , and something as simple as a coffee break can give them a moment of respite in this unimaginably stressful time .
But Fuelling the Frontline is n't the only way Aussies can support those on the frontlines , Marnie explains , adding that self-isolating is more crucial now than ever .
" Buy them a coffee , stay home so their hospital is not overwhelmed and make sure people respect them and are not aggressive towards them , " she tells 9Honey .
