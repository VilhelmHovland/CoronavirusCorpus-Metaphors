Covid-19 : PM Johnson 's adviser Cummings isolating with virus symptoms  The coronavirus outbreak at the heart of the British government spread on Monday with Prime Minister Boris Johnson 's senior adviser , Dominic Cummings , self-isolating with symptoms just days after the British leader himself tested positive .
A Downing Street spokesman confirmed a Daily Mail report that Cummings , one of the most powerful men in the government , had developed symptoms of COVID-19 over the weekend and was now self-isolating .
Johnson on Friday became the first leader of a major world power to test positive for the virus .
His health minister , Matt Hancock , also tested positive and the government 's chief medical adviser , Chris Whitty , is self-isolating .
Britain initially took an approach to containing the spread of the disease that was modest in comparison to European countries such as Italy .
But Johnson imposed stringent controls after projections showed a quarter of a million people could die .
