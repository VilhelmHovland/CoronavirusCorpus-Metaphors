Erlanger Adding Triage Tents Outside Emergency Room Entrances  As part of its ongoing Emergency Management Preparedness plans , Erlanger is in the process of erecting additional triage tents outside its emergency rooms at Erlanger Baroness Hospital , Children 's Hospital at Erlanger and Erlanger East Hospital .
Officials said these tents would allow Erlanger staff to triage individuals experiencing respiratory problems and/or fever in the tents , isolating them from the emergency rooms .
Area residents visiting these emergency rooms with other healthcare conditions or injuries would proceed into the emergency rooms for treatment .
As with other healthcare facilities , this action is being implemented in an abundance of caution in the event of a surge in emergency patients and the need arises to activate the triage tents for medical purposes .
