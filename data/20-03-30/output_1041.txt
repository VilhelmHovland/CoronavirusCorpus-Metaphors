Comments  If Chinese investors own twenty percent of Virgin Airlines why is Australia considering bailing it out of its financial trouble .
How much tax did it pay last year .
and how much tax has Qantas paid in recent years .
Bad news .
c'm on let 's not play it down , all have been under full blown psychological warfare ? ! As for weaning off of this , well it should be apparent by now that most peoples SCREEN/information addiction is just another way of attaining some forms of self-worth/value so as to feel " in the know " , it 's why finding balance in such an environment will be hard and next to impossible for most .
Put simply , the sickness stems from the TOP-&gt;DOWN and most willingly subject themselves to it and go along with it , such is the nature of the addict that takes some form of pleasure in destroying itself .
And of course , the system is there to prey upon and capitalize off of all this .
and here we are worried about a virus ? Perceptions have been well and truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that in " reality " , all of this equates to a form of " debt servitude " for the masses ( especially the youth ) and yet most just do n't seem to give a $hit ? ? .
thus highlighting the true nature of where our current devalued minds sit , and the mental contagion that plagues us all .
Another global failure is that capitalism and our leadership/system can not even enact the most basic aspects of care for the populace and PLAN and PREPARE the nation for the inevitable situation which things like their mock coronavirus pandemic in October 2019 ( event 201 ) foresaw ?  This should have ALL already been planned for , so the need to make rush decisions was n't there .
unless , that is the point of it ?  As for the youngens to remake a new order ? I hope that 's not anything like Channel 7 , 9 and 10 " New World Order " they were all talking about the other day ?  Either way I 'm all for it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these youngens fully understand the nature of the old order and the conditioned nature that stems from it where one was taught seek it 's power/self-worth externally outside of self which in turn disempowers itself and is basically the root of all issues currently being experienced both internally in people 's minds and externally in society .
Because IF they do n't , well they will be doomed to fail as the ego forever strives for MORE ( while justifying it with delusion ) , which then equates to imbalanced systems and things like what we have now .
Most humans are too busy escaping themselves to be open or friendly , which requires a focus on self and the personal growth to enact such things .
Maybe we can start to SEE the catch 22 predicament , where are coping mechanisms actually become the problem .
You ca n't hold onto anger as it only hurts yourself , and this is how the world has been for many decades now .
IF you truly want change , then push for a new political system so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way .
Well , in their defense , a good ' Psyop ' does n't work if they do n't saturate the medium with the same story/information over and over .
And if you do n't think " POWER " is enacting one , is n't everything in this life/world is ( especially a crisis ) there to be capitalized on ?  And there you have it folks , a conflicting and contradicting reality due to the subjective experience of each individual , which should then pose the question .
Is it possible that it 's NOT the young or old but merely this person or that ? That our experienced subjective reality is not " the truth " ?  Likewise , when this mode of thinking is played out by the media ( and the power it serves ) , arguments are being made to suit certain agenda 's .
using the ignorance of the minority to further clamp down on the majority in the never quest for consolidating power and moving up through the stages ? )  The best news I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 8 am this morning , was about a frog that had been operated on to removed a fifth leg that was protruding from its chest and impeding its hopping ability and therefore its survival .
I did do a quick check to make sure it was not yet 1 April .
I did not even know that there was such a wonderful thing as a frog hospital .
It gladdened my heart .
Only problem now is getting the frog back across closed state borders to the place where it was found .
How good are environmentalists who look after frogs - in the wild and in hospital .
I assume you are getting your information from TV without experiencing first hand .
My experience has been totally the opposite .
The biggest offenders for not physical distances are the seniors .
In my two local shopping malls the seniors do n't seem to care .
I find its the younger people that are he most concerned about the situation and seem to comprehend the necessity for physical distancing more .
I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group .
As there is widespread poor compliance and outright disregard with the COVID restrictions amongst Millenials , we need to move to lockups of hotspot suburbs .
Effectively this would be street checkpoints and roving patrols to make sure people abide by the letter of the law and also its intent .
The harder the restrictions , the quicker the virus is contained and the quicker we can get back to normal .
After an interesting couple of days with flu like symptoms , worried about the innocent contacts who might have been close , there is good news : the test was negative .
Not a licence to party .
Distancing makes so much sense .
You may not have heard about the vast amount of electricity used and the amount of heat generated by all those servers and the like around the planet .
seems that they are much more energy intensive then anyone 's home set-up .
The argument for privatisation was always the unproven assertion that private enterprises could run things better than governments .
Then as soon as things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PM 3 .

We need Greg Jericho to draw us an interactive map because it sure as hell is getting confusing in here .
" Its latest plan , a $130 billion wage subsidy program , is on top of the $66 billion in assistance rolled out eight days earlier , which itself came 10 days after the government 's initial $17 .
billion stimulus .
That does n't include the $125 billion of loans and guarantees being offered by the government or Reserve Bank .
Some of that will be lost as businesses find themselves unable to repay their debts .

The " private " bit is new , but they are probably using the Howard model previously used for the Tasmanian Mersey Hospital .
I could explain the details , but it would make everyones ' brain hurt because it makes no sense .
In summary , hundreds of $$$Millions of taxpayers dollars get spent to take control and then similar amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good is free taxpayers money ! https : **33;97;TOOLONG .

No , I did n't Heather ( and Philkin ) , but if it works that way , go ahead !  Heather , I 'm glad your American friend enjoyed it .
they really need a bit of cheering up the way things are going over there at the moment , particularly anyone working in the very vulnerable aged care sector .
Wish her well on my behalf !  There 's one resident ex-Dutchie who we rather distain for his absolute and essential wrong-headedness .

it comes to nefariousness , Sky 's the limit .
I think Israel will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Occupied Territories will soon sky-rocket .
I wonder if PR China will see this as an opportunity to permit a biological final solution to their " Uighur problem " now housed in numerous concentration camps , just as certain people in Australia see this as an opportunity to get rid of the so-called useless non-contributing Ausralian elderly .
With the tax increases leading to $100 per 50g , they have effectively banned them .
Guess what ? There are black market tobacconists everywhere now that sells them at 1/8th the legal price .
Any stats you see showing the effectiveness of this policy is based on the few smokers who are going the legal option .
never learn - there are limits to top-down control .
As a kid at my UK primary school I had a slate in an oak frame and a slate pencil .
And a damp rag to clean it with .
Then , in 1955 we were given lined paper and pencils on which to practise our handwriting .
What a wonderful benefit it was not to have had word processors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills in literacy and numeracy .
We were taught to think twelves , twenties , fours , twos , sixteens , fourteens , sevens , threes , eights , 22s , 112s , 2240s , quarters , halves ; how many can count to 12 , 14 or 16 on one hand using each of the five digits just once ? And then use the other hand to count multiples of 12 , 14 , 16 ? An exercise for kids who are confined to the house these days , perhaps ?  And , in poverty-stricken socialist UK , like the USSR , we used to have a damn good public health service even if we had to catch a bus or ride a bike or call an ambulance to go to hospital .
Doctors often had a car and used to do daily visits to their patients and would come out on call .
A strange world I used to live in !  Is anyone pissed off with assorted assorted billionaires demanding that we , the taxpayer , bail them out ? That retail tenants of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billionaire landlord ? That CEOs who are paid tens of millions of dollars expect their staff to go without jobs or pay for weeks on end .
Is it not time that such rather wealthy people contributed financially to the health of our society ?  It 's just super weird to compare Covid-19 ( for which there is no cure ; no targeted treatment and nowhere on earth is there sufficient ventilators should the worst happen ) with anything else .
perhaps other than Ebola .
He also thought it was a gift from the chief happy clapper to take peoples minds off the sportsrorts and other assorted matters which the opposition was annoying him about .
( Remember those halycon days ? )  What 's all the fuss ? There is still a public sector job running in Canberra that pays $1,509 per day along with a huge free fully-serviced commission home and a free chauffeured limousine .
I checked just 2 minutes ago and , yes , we are still paying for it .

If you are " all over it already " there is a good chance that you are prepared to expose yourself and others to the deadly virus .
Absolutely hysterical language .
I am not .
I am NOT GOING TO CATCH THIS FUCKING VIRUS .
THAT IS THE POINT .
This means I can can say what I feel though , surely or are you one of those nazis who support Morrison 's destruction of Australia ?  Not IMMEDIATELY but premature and painful death are more likely if a person smokes .
I suppose like climate change politicians believe the consequences wo n't be seen in their term of office so they do nothing about it .
Politicians did this 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now more susceptible to corona virus .
So there is a bit of delayed karma for you .
Sometimes it takes a while but actions have consequences eventually .
