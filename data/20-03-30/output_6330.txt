Because of this , donation drives have been providing marginalized sectors with care packages to help them get by during this crisis .
Feminine hygiene kits are seldom prioritized in donation drives for the marginalized , despite being a necessity for most women .
As a self-identified feminist publishing house , Power In Her Story ( PIHR ) acknowledges this current situation .
" Access to personal care products such as sanitary pads should be available to women and girls , " says PIHR founder Nikki Luna .
" Our bleeding does not stop , and it should be part of essential needs when distributing goods to the most vulnerable .
"  PIHR began the donation drive by only disseminating free sanitary pads to underprivileged communities , but the collective soon included rice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs " to address women 's needs more comprehensively at a situation such as this .
Aside from Luna , who is an artist , PIHR comprises other women from diverse backgrounds : government organization officers Chang Jordan and Twyla Rubin ; artist Lara De Los Reyes ; and poet Faye Cura .
Jordan and Rubin spearhead the collection , purchasing , and repacking of donations , as well as the coordination with beneficiary communities .
PIHR focuses their efforts in the benefit of women with disabilities and their families from four areas : Barangay Holy Spirit and Batasan in Quezon City , North Bay Boulevard North in Navotas , and Peoples ' Plainville in Manila .
The collective also attends to families of EJK and tokhang victims , and has distributed feminine care to three hospitals for staff working ' round the clock during this crisis .
