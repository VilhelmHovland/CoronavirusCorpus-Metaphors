Smith : Trying to deal without the rhythm of sports  1of2The rhythm of sports , like batting practice before a game , are all out of sync because of the coronavirus pandemic .
: Karen Warren , Houston Chronicle / Staff photographer  2of2The sports clock is broken , much like this one during a Rockets game earlier this season , and wo n't reset until the coronavirus pandemic wanes .
: Brett Coomer , Houston Chronicle / Staff photographer  What time is it ?  What day is it ?  How much longer is this going to last ? May ? June ? .
September ?  The more we talk , listen and hear during the chaos of the coronavirus , the more this becomes clear : It 's the uncertainty that can really drive you mad .
Sports used to set our daily calendar .
Our lives ran like clockwork .
Mike D'Antoni in a Toyota Center hallway at 5:15 p .
Always on time -- sometimes a couple minutes early .
Backed up against a wall and calmly answering all the big , pressing questions about his basketball team .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 p .
It was always there .
You could count and depend on it .
The Astros ' manager almost four hours before the first pitch inside Minute Maid Park , sitting inside the home dugout as gloves popped and balls began to make bats crack .
Then the Astros on the green grass and your TV at 7 p .
For 162 regular-season games .
From late March through late September , then throughout October .
And if the Astros had a rare off day , there was always another live baseball game somewhere else on your TV .
On Sunday evening , April 30 suddenly became the new hopeful target date for America .
The spring promise of Easter already was in the rear view .

Small businesses would keep suffering during the social-distance age .
The sports world , obviously , would remain frozen .
Maybe America would be in a better place and could re-open by April 30 .
Maybe .
Monday , Macy 's announced that the majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued impact of the coronavirus .
On the same day , the 2020 Summer Olympics were rescheduled for July 23 through Aug .

If you 're counting on the calendar , that 's almost 16 months away .
I work out in the garage with the door a quarter open , so sunlight and fresh air stream through .
I feel fortunate to do that , the moment I click on the nightly national news .
ESPN at 7 p .
Monday : A replay of a November 2018 contest between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Rams .
Great game .
But a little outdated as April approaches in 2020 .
ESPN2 at the same time : A 2004 women 's soccer match between Mexico and the United States .
During the good ol ' days , the leader of the televised sports world would have found a way to get the New York Yankees on one channel and the Boston Red Sox on another , with both American League East clubs dominating your TV at the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website Monday , a prominently placed video featured pop music star Justin Bieber walking on furniture and riding a skateboard ( while wearing pajamas ) in what appears to be a very expensive house .
When I say everything is out of whack , I mean everything is out of whack .
There has recently been talk that college football could also scrap its 2020 season .

Anthony Fauci declares it in a few months behind a presidential podium , we might believe it .
Otherwise , we 're already dealing with enough hourly stress and worry , and the last thing anyone in America needs to hear right now is that church wo n't be in service on Saturdays this fall .
The days drag .
but also fly by .
Mostly , they just stack together , with Monday becoming Tuesday , Tuesday becoming Friday , and the weekend feeling just like Monday and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sports world had clearly defined schedules .
The world feels so strange right now .

Certain , reliable and predictable , simply by appearing live on TV at the normal time .
