Highfield director of rugby says club are well placed despite missing promotion  Daire Walsh  DESPITE having their campaign cut short due to the Coronavirus outbreak , there is more than enough reason for Highfield RFC to be positive about the road that lies ahead .
If you cast your mind back to April 2016 , the Cork club were in a much different place to the one they currently find themselves in .
With one round remaining in Division 2B of the All-Ireland League , they were one point adrift of City of Derry at the summit of the table .
However , thanks to a bonus-point triumph over Bective Rangers -- which bettered the Ulster side 's own victory against MU Barnhall -- they claimed the fourth-tier title and have n't looked back since .
They secured the Division 2A crown last season and , with four games remaining in this term , the Woodleigh Park outfit were on the brink of reaching the top-flight of the AIL .
Unfortunately , the league has ultimately been brought to a premature end as a consequence of COVID-19 and Highfield will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of rugby , Billy Quinlan , insists they will retain a positive outlook in advance of their eventual return to competitive action .
" The club is in a good position .
We 've had a very good coaching structure in place .
Very good off-the-field structure .
We 've a superb group of players .
There 's good player welfare up there .
" The guys get their grub after training on Thursdays , small things like this .
Robert Bogue , who was director of rugby before me up to this year , he did a brilliant job , " Quinlan asserted .
" There 's years of hard work from our point of view .
Whatever happens , we 'll bounce back , take it on the chin .
We 'll do whatever we need to do .
Whatever happens next year , we 'll come back stronger .
"  A former player with Highfield , Quinlan assumed his current role from the Bogue at the tail end of 2019 .
As he explains , it has been a seamless transition .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years .
I 'd know a lot of the people involved .
I know the structure up there .
Robert Bogue is still involved .
We 've good people involved in the club right through .
" Invariably with good people involved , you 'll have good decisions made .
It has been easy enough .
There 's been a lot of hands on deck .
It makes it a lot easier .
You 're not thrown in at the deep end .
"  One man who has played a massive part in the Highfield revolution , both on an off the field , has been player/coach Timmy Ryan .
A former tighthead prop with Munster , Toulon and Newcastle Falcons ( among others ) , the 35-year-old has transformed the fortunes of the Leesiders in recent years transposing his vast knowledge of the professional game onto Ireland 's domestic scene .
He is now expected to move onto pastures new and Quinlan hailed the impact made by Ryan during his second stint at the club .
" Timmy has been brilliant for the club in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed because it seems like he 's moving on to Wales .
He brought a lot of experience , he brought a winning mentality .
" He changed the psyche of the team and the club , in many ways .
Again , that would n't have happened without people buying into it off the pitch as well .
" People gave him licence to do it because they recognised he could do it and it has worked really well .
Highfield always in the past have been described as a sleeping giant and what have you .
With Timmy 's help , I think that 's been laid to rest .
"  Highfield 's Paddy Ryan desperately holds onto the ball during the AIL match against Shannon at Woodleigh Park at the outset of the campaign .
Picture : Howard Crowdy  It is n't all geared towards the senior men 's team down in Woodleigh Park , though , as they have maintained a competitive edge at virtually every grade and level of competition .
The second team had climbed to third spot in Munster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 10 games in the South Junior 2 League .
Additionally , they also enjoyed a productive campaign in the U20 Donal Walsh Plate -- finishing a single point behind pace-setters Bruff .
" We 've 40-odd training between the firsts and the seconds .
On the J2s we have 30-odd training as well and we 've an U20 team .
Just before the outbreak of the coronavirus , we had entered a team in the J3 plate even .
It shows you , our numbers are great .
People are enjoying it , it 's a good place to be at the moment and long may it continue , " Quinlan said .
Yet , there is still some room for growth within the club .
Having spent many years in the sole division of their All-Ireland League , the Highfield senior women have struggled for numbers in the past couple of seasons .
With current Ireland internationals Leah Lyons , Ellen Murphy and Laura Sheehan having lined out for the club in the recent past , Quinlan acknowledged it will be important to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look up to .
" I think with the women 's , the numbers seemed to dwindle a bit .
I think it ran its course up there , more than anything .
The numbers just were n't there to sustain it .
I think we were one of the only clubs in Cork for a long , long time with a women 's team .
" We 've four adult teams up already and very strong underage .
We 're very much a community club .
That says it all really , we 're open to anything , " Quinlan added .
