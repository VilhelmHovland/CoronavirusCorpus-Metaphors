Following the two-week lockdown declared by president Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo , some commercial vehicles , popularly known as trotro will be affected economically because of the social distancing policy .
Due to this , a health economist at the University of Ghana , Dr Abekah-Nkrumah has advised government to train these drivers who are willing to work how to drive the country 's Aayalolo buses .
According to him , deploying more Aayalolo buses in Accra will help check the social distancing policy put in place as one of the measures to help prevent the contraction of the pandemic which is fast spreading .
Also , these drivers can be tracked as they are mandated to load from government-designated stations in the region .
In his view , instead of the trotro drivers working , " Let 's flood the cities with these ( Aayalolo ) buses because we can control them and then the trotro people who want to work can be given these buses to drive with a little bit of training and work with the trotro people so that if they are supposed to load , they are no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the government designated station and in that case the numbers can reduce , " he said in an interview with CitiTV 's Big Issue Saturday , March 28 , 2020 .
