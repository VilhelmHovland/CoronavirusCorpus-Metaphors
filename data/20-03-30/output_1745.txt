The Consumer Council has warned of the multiple risks of a skin-injection beauty treatment that has been gaining popularity recently .
The so-called " intradermal micro injection procedure " involves a device with multiple micro-needles that would inject different types of chemicals like botox , hyaluronic acid and vitamin into the skin .
The council 's Michael Hui said the treatment is invasive as it would leave numerous wounds on the skin , and infections may occur if the wounds are not properly treated .
He said the chemicals used can vary in quality as well .
Also , after the watchdog looked at more than 30 websites promoting the procedure , it found that two-third of them did not state clearly whether it will be conducted by registered doctors .
It said it had referred the cases to the health bureau .
