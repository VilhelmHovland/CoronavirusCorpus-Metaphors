The idea started in Italy , the worst-hit country by the coronavirus pandemic , with 10,779 deaths and 97,689 cases .
AFP reports about one such hospital , Erasme Hospital on the outskirts of Belgium 's capital Brussels which is attached to the city 's ULB university , and through it to a private spin-off , Endo Tools Therapeutics , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" They are to be used for patients with severe respiratory problems .
The aim is to avoid having to intubate the trachea of the patient and put them on a respirator , " said Frederic Bonnier , a respiratory physiotherapist at the hospital who also teaches at the university .
He spearheaded the design of a custom-made valve that fits to the top of full-face masks , where the snorkel is meant to go , allowing them to connect to standard BiPAP machines that feed pressurised air into masks .
This helps prevent the collapse of alveoli , lung air sacs needed for the intake of oxygen into our bodies and the exhalation of carbon dioxide .
Pneumonia brought on by COVID-19 inflames the lung membrane and fills those sacs with liquid .
In the worst-case infections , patients have to be hooked up to respirators in intensive-care units .
But respirators are in desperately short supply worldwide because of the overwhelming number of patients .
The snorkelling mask solution could be a stop-gap measure for patients on the brink of intensive-care treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospital masks for the less-intensive BiPAP ( bilevel positive airway pressure ) machines are also lacking .
Bonnier said that from Monday he will be testing 50 of the masks on patients .
They are the same brand as those used by Italian doctors , donated by the French sportswear retailer Decathlon that has stores worldwide .
The masks themselves are made in Italy .
He also said that , even if the tests prove conclusive , there were still questions about how many such masks could be made available by sporting companies , under what conditions .
Learning of the emergency use being made of its snorkelling masks , Decathlon expressed " interest " but also prudence .
" At the moment we do n't have confirmation that these solutions really work , " it said on its Twitter account .
" If we see successful try-outs , and these hospitals confirm to us that some tests work , then we 'll keep you informed .
But in the meantime , beware of unsourced and unverified information spread on social media in recent days .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported shortage of masks .
A report by Wall Street Journal says , China 's auto makers , the world 's biggest iPhone assembler and even state-owned energy companies are using their assembly lines to pump out more face masks and other medical supplies as the country responds to a coronavirus outbreak that has spread around the world .
Masks are crucial for health care workers , doctors , and nurses working on the front lines of the disease to have the proper protective gear to lower the risk of contracting Covid-19 .
According to Vox , America 's mask supply is being so rapidly depleted that even the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested homemade masks , like bandanas or scarves , " as a last resort " for health care providers in " settings where face masks are not available .
