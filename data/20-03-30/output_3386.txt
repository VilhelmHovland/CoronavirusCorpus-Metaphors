F1 team helps to create coronavirus breathing aid  A breathing aid that can help keep coronavirus patients out of intensive care has been created in under a week .
University College London engineers worked with clinicians at UCLH and Mercedes Formula One to build the device , which delivers oxygen to the lungs without needing a ventilator .
Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) devices are already used in hospitals but are in short supply .
China and Italy used them to help Covid-19 patients .

If trials go well , up to 1,000 of the CPAP machines can be produced per day by Mercedes-AMG-HPP , beginning in a week 's time .
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) has already given its approval for their use .
This reduces the effort needed to breathe in , especially when the alveoli -- the air sacs in the lungs -- have collapsed as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an oxygen supply , CPAP delivers air and oxygen under pressure , so there needs to be a mask creating a tight seal on the patient 's face , over their mouth and nose or a transparent hood over their head .
This is less invasive than a ventilator , for which patients have to be heavily sedated and have a tube inserted into their airway .
But a note of caution was sounded by Duncan Young , Prof of Intensive Care Medicine , University of Oxford , who said : " The use of CPAP machines in patients with contagious respiratory infections is somewhat controversial as any small leaks round the mask could spray droplets of secretions on to attending clinical staff .
"  Prof Mervyn Singer said if a tight seal is maintained on the mask or , even better , a helmet is worn , and clinical staff have adequate personal protective equipment ( PPE ) then this risk would be minimised .
More than 2,000 Covid-19 patients are receiving CPAP on general wards in Lombardy .
Andy Cowell , Managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Formula One community has shown an impressive response to the call for support .
we have been proud to put our resources at the service of UCL to deliver the CPAP project to the highest standards and in the fastest possible timeframe .
"  As well as Mercedes F1 , the collaboration also included Oxford Optronix , a small business that has manufactured oxygen monitors for the devices .
