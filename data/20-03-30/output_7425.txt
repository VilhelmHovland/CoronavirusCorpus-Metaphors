OPINION  Briggs : Eric Holcomb , not Donald Trump , will decide when we go back to work  Trump on Sunday extended his administration 's guidelines on social distancing until April 30 .
The instructions include avoiding gatherings of 10 or more people and not making unnecessary trips .
Trump added that he expects by June 1 " we will be well on our way to recovery .
"  Trump has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting in areas with few confirmed COVID-19 cases , igniting a controversy over whether that is prudent at a time when the pandemic is worsening .
I argued in a previous column that it is not .

Eric Holcomb speaks to the media and others present at the Indiana Statehouse during a press conference to give an update on COVID-19 and its impact on Indiana on Monday , March 16 , 2020 .
( Photo : Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar )  The debate matters insofar as the president sets the tone and people are likely to adjust their behaviors according to Trump 's position .
On a practical level , though , states and cities have taken over the leadership role during the pandemic and almost all of the coronavirus-related restrictions have been established locally .
Trump acknowledged this framework in a letter he sent last week to governors conveying his enthusiasm for getting things back to normal as soon as possible .
" My Administration is working to publish new guidelines for State and local policymakers to use in making decisions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mitigation measures they have put in place , " the letter said .
The operative word there is guidelines .
While the Trump administration can lay down suggestions in hopes that states follow them -- as the president did Sunday -- governors , mayors and other local officials are going to be the ones who decide what to do about it .

( Photo : Mykal McEldowney/IndyStar )  Holcomb has issued a stay-at-home order , which means people are only allowed to go out for essential activities , such as buying groceries and performing important work .
But other states have not gone as far .
Mississippi , for example , is still allowing restaurant dining rooms to remain open , which seems contrary to existing Trump administration guidelines , and only about half of the states have issued stay-at-home orders .

Trump last week characterized the federal government 's role as a " backup " to states during a conference call with governors , according to The Washington Post .
Washington Gov .
Jay Inslee retorted , " We do n't need a backup .
We need a Tom Brady , " according to The Post .
Holcomb , a Republican , seems more content than other governors with the Trump administration 's role .
Holcomb during a press conference last week said Trump told governors , " You will be in command of this , " and added that he appreciates having flexibility to make decisions specific to Indiana .
Holcomb also does n't seem inclined to rush Indiana back into normalcy .
Holcomb 's stay-at-home order lasts through April 7 and schools are closed through May 1 , though both dates seem likely to be extended .

Trump has clear motivations for wanting to reopen businesses and institutions , ranging from slowing the deluge of unemployment filings to improving his re-election odds .
It 's ultimately going to be up to governors , though .
If you 're wondering when schools and businesses will reopen in Indiana , you should pay more attention to Holcomb than to Trump .
