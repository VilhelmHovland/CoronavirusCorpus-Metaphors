Mark Smith : My conversation with a Yes campaigner that points to one way out of all this  Mark Smith : My conversation with a Yes campaigner that points to one way out of all this  I get it .
You miss socialising .
You miss going to the pub , you miss going for Sunday dinner at your mum 's , you miss the chats by the school gates , and the gym , and the office canteen , and coffee with Bill or Susan or whoever .
But how about this for an idea ? When we get to the other side of all this and start socialising again , could we do things differently ? It might be the answer we 've been looking for .
The reason I 'm saying all of this now is because of a conversation I had recently with a Yes campaigner .
You 'll know him : Alan Bissett .
He 's a novelist , performer , and famous Falkirkian , and he was one of the leading figures of the 2014 campaign and one of its most passionate agitators .
Alan and I were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sadly ) to mark the 700th anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath , but the turn the conversation took was surprising .
It did n't go how you would expect .
The thing is that , for a while now , a lot of Scots who lean towards the Union have felt like we 're living in an age of conflict , and that the 2014 referendum was partly -- no , largely -- to blame for that .
But even if you disagree with that premise , or the cause , you might still agree about where we are now : Yes versus No , Leave versus Remain , Salmond versus Sturgeon , the human race versus Covid-19 .
Even the attempt to control the coronavirus is described in terms of conflict -- we are at war , they say ; we are fighting an invisible enemy .
But what if there 's a different way of framing this and a new way forward ? When we had our chat , Alan Bissett told me he was just as much a supporter of Yes in 2020 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disaster , he said , and Scots find themselves trapped and buffeted without any control of their political destiny .
Independence needs to happen sooner rather than later , he said .
It 's an emergency .
But it 's what Alan told me next that was really interesting because I think lots of Scots feel the same way , even if their actual views have n't shifted much .
What Alan said was that , for him , a lot of the heat had gone out of the argument since 2014 .
In the old days , he said , he would 've gone on the attack , but he 's better now at listening to people with different views , and has more respect for them .
He still argues the case for Yes , but he does it with less of an edge in his voice .
Why has this happened ? It 's because Alan 's been mixing with different people .
In 2014 , he was living in Glasgow and working in the arts and most of the people he socialised with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country and lives in a small village where he comes into contact with a more diverse range of opinion .
Down the pub ( when we 're allowed to go down the pub again ) there are going to be lots of unionists and this fact has changed the way Alan approaches things .
The lessons he has taken away from it all are interesting .
Here 's what he said to me : " I 'm talking to guys who might have very different opinions to me and if you start being too forthright about it , they 're going to tell you to f*** off .
They 'll probably see you as some a******* who comes into the pub and spouts off about Scottish independence .
I ca n't be that person .
It does n't work .
So it 's made me a better communicator and more reflective when it comes to politics .
I 've got better at listening .
"  Of course this does n't apply to everyone -- just look at Twitter .
The opinion poll at the weekend suggesting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another independence referendum more likely , which will surely get the blood boiling just as much as it did in 2014 .
But even so , for a lot of people , the passage of time , or a change of scene in Alan 's case , or the spread of an invisible virus , has made the debate feel much less aggressive than it was , and we should try to go with that .
We should try to learn something from the moment of calm that some of us are feeling .
I think Alan has already , and I hope I have too .
One of the subjects we talked about was identity and how important it is to both sides of the argument over the constitution in Scotland .
Alan said he was more aware , and respectful , of the fact that many Scots feel British and want to remain British .
It 's their identity , and the same works the other way round for Scottish nationalists : they feel attached to their identity and , let 's face it , even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all recognise and respect those facts .
We can also do what Alan has done and pull back a little from the swing and punch of Yes and No .
A good first step would be to come off Twitter , which Alan has already done -- Twitter is merely fuel to the fury and is not the place for nuance or respect .
We could also -- when we 're allowed to -- socialise with a much more diverse range of people , which Alan has also done .
If you 're a Yes voter , make sure that your first post-Covid coffee is with a No voter and vice versa for unionists .
And do n't just wait for them to stop talking so you can make your point .
Listen .
I appreciate some people will think all of this is na ? ve , but a more respectful conversation is more likely to produce a settled will that we can all go along with in the end and that 's what we need .
Obviously , Alan Bissett hopes the settled will is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union .
But it 's more likely to be a broad agreement or a settled consensus if it comes from a long , respectful , reflective conversation rather than a political punch-up .
If we listen to each other and slowly move in one direction , it 's more likely to last .
If we respect each other , we will respect the result .
I 'm going to try to remember that when I come out of isolation .
