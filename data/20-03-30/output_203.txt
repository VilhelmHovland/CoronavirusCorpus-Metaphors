The organisation , which deals with Carlow and parts of Laois and Wicklow , was told on Monday by the Courts Service and An Garda S ? och ? na that judges will be appointed to hear protection order applications .
" People are anxious .
These are families who were in complicated situations beforehand , so this the pandemic only adds to it .
But when all the supports have fallen away , it 's much more difficult , " said Anton Scheele of Carlow Women 's Aid .
" That 's throwing up loads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting is also growing , " said Mr Scheele .
' Holed up '  The restrictions are forcing the abuser and abused together : " When people do n't get on , it 's messy .
People are holed up in the one space and there 's a lot of trauma already there .
"  Some victims are no longer living with their abuser but are now sharing homes with teenage boys who " have grown used to seeing their mother treated with disrespect , " he added .
" Some of those boys have seen how their fathers were to their mother .
If you 're surviving or trying to cope with trauma , then having a strapping 14-year-old in the home can be challenging , " he went on .
The closure of creches has caused issues : " Without the creche , it 's one less space to get away from traumatic homes , " said Mr Scheele .
