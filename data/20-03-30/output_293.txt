The Timberwolves organization has been hit with a lot of difficult times over its franchise history , obviously including the deaths of fan favorite Malik Sealy caused by a drunken driver in 2000 and of the biggest architect of the franchise in Flip Saunders in 2015 .
The Wolves are now dealing with another difficult scenario .
This past week , star forward Karl-Anthony Towns revealed both his parents had tested positive for the coronavirus that has shut down sports and most of the world for the immediate future .
The 24-year-old said his mother , Jacqueline Cruz , was having trouble breathing and was put in a medically induced coma to fight the illness .
The Towns news was devastating to the local sports community and especially to the Wolves , who have had close contact with his family since drafting him No .
1 overall in 2015 and making him the face of this franchise .
One bit of very good news reported Thursday was that Towns ' father , Karl Towns Sr .
, was recovering from the virus at home and doing much better .
The Wolves put out a statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , made note of the great generosity that Towns had shown by donating $100,000 to the Mayo Clinic earlier this month to fight this illness , long before he had his own personal connection .
Everyone in the sports world is hoping for nothing but the best for Towns and his family .
A difficult rebuilding season  While the Towns news is obviously at the front of everyone 's minds , this already had been a tough season for the Wolves from an operational standpoint .
Before the March 11 shutdown , they ranked last in the NBA in average home attendance with an announced 15,066 fans per game this season , and they were already hurting financially .
Now of course there is the real chance the Wolves wo n't get to play their final 18 regular-season games , which will not only hurt the team financially but , more important , will be damaging to the development of a young roster that was trying to bring some positive momentum to the franchise .
Yes , this season has been one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away Andrew Wiggins could n't have been an easy decision for the front office after the team gave him a five-year , $147 million contract in 2017 .
Wiggins was supposed to be a cornerstone of the franchise alongside Towns , but it was clear that the Wolves wanted to make a move for a player who fit better alongside Towns .
So out went Wiggins and in came All-Star point guard D'Angelo Russell .
But since that big trade , Russell and Towns have played in only one game together -- a competitive 137-126 loss on the road to the defending NBA champion Toronto Raptors .
If those two do not get the rest of the season to jell and build a connection on the court , that would make this offseason even more crucial for the franchise going forward .
Rosas and Saunders ' plan  After the Wolves made all of their trades in February , President of Basketball Operations Gersson Rosas said just how important it was for this group to play together under coach Ryan Saunders , even if qualifying for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining games are critically important to us .
I 've said it from the beginning , this year is about building identity .
It 's building chemistry , building habits , and it is painful .
These first 50 games , it was painful to go through the growing pains , " Rosas said .
" But as I have said often , you have to know who you are , you have to know what you have and you have to know what you need .
Ryan has been an unbelievable partner .
He has executed the vision day in and day out .
" It was our job to add more talent to the base .
The reality for us is we 're building the foundation of a sustainable organization , and every day matters to us .
Finishing strong is very important and seeing what we can do the rest of the year .
It goes into the summer and into next season .
What we do now impacts our future every day .
"  Rosas came in with a vision to change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February .
" We 've turned things over pretty aggressively .
But it 's with a purpose , " Rosas said .
" It 's about building the future , building a foundation , and it 's the opportunity to do something different .
Minnesota and these fans deserve it .
We hope to continue to see them because we have an exciting ride coming up .
"  You have to hope that with some of the positive news coming out of the NBA -- such as the fact that Utah Jazz stars Rudy Gobert and Donovan Mitchell , the first players to have tested positive for the coronavirus , no longer pose a risk to transmit the disease to others -- that maybe there is still time for practices and games to get going and for the Wolves to get a chance to return to action to complete what has been a difficult season .

When has that ever happened ? "  * Tajae Sharpe , the newest Vikings receiver , was a fifth-round pick by the Titans in the 2016 draft .
