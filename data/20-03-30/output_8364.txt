Leave a Comment  Why The Voice Needs To Change How It Releases New Seasons  With the spread of COVID-19 and the restrictions on gatherings being mandated worldwide , many shows have been interrupted .
Of course , The Voice is no exception as Season 18 will soon run out of pre-taped episodes and will not be able to shoot new ones until the restrictions have been lifted .
This likely means that Season 19 of The Voice wo n't happen until 2021 , and the longer I 've thought about it , that may not be a bad thing .
The Voice has pushed a pretty fast pace of two seasons a year since Season 3 , and it is n't hard to see why .
The singing competition has been a strong ratings contender throughout its run and , at the end of the day , networks will continue to stick with what works in that regard as competition continues to mount for the attention of live audiences .
The Voice has n't struggled to maintain that pace , though I 'd argue there has been some stagnation in quality in more recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpopular with audiences , possibly because there was n't enough time to think them through .
More planning for an individual season would allow for crew to better test resulting changes they want to make and figure out how they could impact seasons in a negative or positive way .
One season a year would also allow The Voice audience to breathe a bit between seasons .
The jump between seasons is so fast that there 's rarely a chance for fans to really embrace the season 's latest winner .
Many of The Voice 's winning alumni have n't reached the levels of success of contestants who have appeared on American Idol , and I think the pace of seasons could be a factor in that .
With the show churning out two winners a year , it 's kind of hard to keep tabs or make a win feel as significant as it should .
Could doing one season in a year fix some of The Voice 's lingering issues ? It 's not something NBC has seemingly stopped to consider in recent years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COVID-19 pandemic .
Provided the competition does n't try to greatly condense Season 18 in order to still squeeze in Season 19 in the fall , there will likely only be one season of The Voice this year .
Granted , we do n't know exactly what NBC plans are for Season 18 of The Voice .
Many networks are going to have to drastically alter their programming in the future , and shows like American Idol and The Voiceare especially complicated .
Condensing a season would be a move that feels remarkably unfair to contestants , and would likely make fans feel like they 've wasted their time tuning in to cheer for these hopeful singers in the first place .
American Idol will be fine finishing the rest of its season ahead of the next one , but NBC may just have to go back to one season and take that time to re-evaluate where the show is at .
