Hamburger menu  In politics , it 's called a pivot .
And in politics , a weekend is an eternity .
Thus the move Monday by the Justin Trudeau government to widen the breadth of its proposed wage subsidy .
Plan A was faulty , Plan B is likely less so .
Its initial concept last Friday was to limit the subsidies to small and medium-sized businesses -- those with fewer than 500 employees .
On the surface that might sound like help for the neediest , but it would have created two artificial classes of Canadian commerce -- those underwritten , those left to their own devices .
Now there will be two more natural classes of Canadian commerce -- those in severe decline will get help , while those faring short of triage or even prospering will not .
Still feels like we might need a Plan C .
Plan B focuses on a magical 30% mark .
If a company 's revenues have fallen that much since March 15 , the federal government will provide 75% of wages on the first $58,700 per employee .
Which means a subsidy of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear .
Why $58,700 ? It 's an arbitrary number .
I could n't find any rhyme nor reason for it and not , say , $60,000 , but it happens to be the same ceiling for pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan .
Trudeau noted a couple of times it means $847 a week for employees via their employers .
But not for every company .
Ottawa does n't see fit to support those losing 29% or less .
It 's an odd way of rewarding those few firms that have lost heavily but found wise ways to not completely crater , or those who know the darkest period is ahead and there is nothing to be done about it .
It is also , in a bizarre way , almost an incentive to tank .
A graduated system would be fairer if the threshold is n't done away with .
nation 's financial officers and accountants are definitely in the saddle as we speak , and relief for a different threshold of pain seems to be in order .
Trudeau has been treating his daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treats an election campaign , with an announcement a day and a news cycle with one message track .
The track Monday could have been that the government is here to help and will not stop until we are smothered in it .
Instead it was that big , bad old business had better not monkey around with the numbers and the system .
( Which , it might be noted , was what would have easily happened with Plan A ; companies of 510 employees would have found themselves magically at a 499 headcount .
)  " We are trusting you to do the right thing , " he said , moving into mannerisms cultivated in an earlier career , eventually adding , " And if you think this is a system you can game or take advantage of , do n't .
" There will be " serious consequences .
"  This had the same stab at gravitas that " stay home " and " the blockades must come down , now .
" As message tracks go , we could have used a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Businesses have been in general freefall for weeks , even months .
Most engines are running on fumes or sputtered out .
The sudden shock to the demand end of our economics is unprecedented and indefinite .
A couple of extra nods in that direction would have been better than to be made grateful to have our money spent on us .
We are all in a trust relationship at the moment .
We are having to trust that our authorities have done the right thing by our health .
We are having to trust our institutions to lead .
We are having to assume companies will do the right thing in this crisis .
We are having to trust our friends and families not to have taken unnecessary risks with their health or with ours .
We are having to trust ourselves to act ethically and sensibly in this absurdly dangerous time .
We all know there are " serious consequences " for any lapse by anyone .
We will remember how each of us behaved during this disastrous period .
It 's the Canadian way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to be reminded .
