Please see the 420 Intel article below :  " As the world slows down and many people go on lockdown , using CBD oil can be a beneficial tool to promote balance and wellness in you , your family members , and even your pet .
It 's clear that we as a human community have not experienced anything quite like what we are facing today .
While there have been mass epidemics in the past , the newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause and learning new ways to take care of ourselves .
During this period of social distancing , self-care is more important than ever .
While staying connected through phone calls , social media , and apps like Facetime can prove to be very helpful for mental well being , we want to share a few ways CBD oil can promote health and wellness during these particularly tough times .
How You Can Benefit from Daily Servings of CBD Oil  Everyone is feeling the ramifications of the coronavirus outbreak in ways small and large .
With the weight of self-isolation , disruptions to many work schedules , and the uneasiness that comes with daily news updates , it 's no wonder we 're all feeling a bit unbalanced .
In the midst of all of this , slowing down and putting our health first right now is paramount .
You may need to take a step back , limit distractions , and focus on healthy behaviors like meditation , exercise , journaling , sleep , nutritious eating , and limiting screen time .
Adding CBD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a highly effective and efficient way to encourage balance in your life right now .
CBD oil is an all-natural , non-intoxicating extract of the common hemp plant that provides your body with the balancing benefits of CBD and a wide array of beneficial plant-based nutrients that support a complete diet .
CBD helps naturally promote homeostasis by providing support to your body 's endocannabinoid system , a major regulatory network responsible for maintaining homeostasis so that functions can perform more optimally .
A long list of functions is kept in check by a well-operating endocannabinoid system , helping you feel better every day .
As you face the unique challenges of this unprecedented time , we have developed a list of ways CBD oil can benefit you while you stay in , stay connected , and stay healthy .
Promoting Balance During These Unsteady Times  Let 's be honest , remaining calm during a pandemic when food shelves are empty and work is on hold is a challenge , period .
In other words , if you 're finding it challenging to stay centered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endocannabinoid system , CBD oil can naturally promote a sense of balance in the body .
A more efficient endocannabinoid system positively impacts various functions , including mood .
It 's important to point out here that CBD oil , when derived from hemp , does n't have any intoxicating properties , so you 're not going to experience anything like a " couch-lock " effect .
Consumers who regularly use CBD oil often report that they feel " a sense of calm " or " more centered " over time .
If you 're looking for a type of CBD oil to help encourage overall balance , try a higher-concentrated product like our RSHO ? Blue Label Pure CBD Oil packaged in a convenient oral applicator or our RSHO ? Gold Label CBD Oil Liquid .
Both can be placed under the tongue for the fastest absorption or added to foods to be absorbed through the digestive system .
Once you ingest the pure CBD oil or CBD oil liquid , the CBD will interact with cannabinoid receptors throughout your body , stimulating your endocannabinoid system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regularly-Washed Dry Hands  Yep , we are all back in preschool again when it comes to washing hands .
The Center for Disease Control is telling us to do it and do it right this time .
Clean hands save lives is the message , and we are on board .
But the " wet , lather , scrub , rinse , dry " protocol can take a toll on your hands .
And if you 've been regularly using hand sanitizers made with harsh alcohol , there is no doubt your hands could use some CBD oil goodness .
CBD oil offers many skincare benefits including nourishing , moisturizing , and rejuvenating the skin .
That 's right- not all CBD oil has to be ingested or inhaled .
A CBD topical is more focused and targeted in delivering its natural balancing and wellness effects .
When applied to the skin , CBD never reaches your bloodstream but instead interacts with cannabinoid receptors just below the skin 's surface , allowing you to direct the extract 's powerful benefits right to where they 're needed .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skincare products contain ingredients like beeswax , lavender , cedarwood , and camphora essential oils to nourish the skin .
One of the top ways to promote and maintain good health is sleep .
If a worldwide pandemic is n't keeping you up at night , hats off to you .
For the others who are finding it challenging to get a restful sleep at night , following healthy sleep habits like a mindful strategy shortly before bedtime ( yoga , deep breathing , meditation ) and reducing screen time is key .
CBD oil naturally promotes better rest at night by supporting balance in the body through its influence on the body 's endocannabinoid system .
While CBD oil does n't have any sedation effects , a more efficient EC system positively impacts all the body 's regular functions , including sleep habits .
During a viral outbreak , people tend to be more aware of their own physical health .
Leading to questions like , was that just a cough ? Or , what does this sore throat really mean ? The immune system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time like this , its importance is magnified .
There is no evidence that CBD oil can cure COVID-19 , but with its spectrum of cannabinoids and nutrients , it can be a beneficial aspect in supporting a balanced immune system .
A well-operating endocannabinoid system keeps the immune system in check , thus promoting a balanced immune response and better health .
If you 're looking to use CBD oil to promote immune system support , consider our Immune Support Capsules , made with natural vegan immune-supportive ingredients like turmeric root , black pepper , and our high-quality CBD oil .
Another good option is our RSHO ? Green Label Liquid , which delivers the exciting natural benefits of raw CBD oil in a convenient liquid form .
Keep Your Pet Balanced  Many people are on lockdown , forced to work from home and avoid social interactions .
Having a pet to love and feel the love from , especially during social distancing , is known to be an incredible advantage for mental wellness .
Amid the Coronavirus , many pet owners have more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awesome for some pets , schedule changes and tension in pet owners can lead to challenges for our furry friends .
The good news , hemp oil can be beneficial for pets too .
In the same way CBD supports your endocannabinoid system , the cannabinoid can also stimulate a dog or cat 's endocannabinoid system and encourage wellness .
CBD 's influence on the endocannabinoid system promotes pets ' cardiovascular function , supports healthy joints , encourages neurological health and emotional behavior , helps maintain stamina , and promotes healthy skin and coat .
With pure CBD oil , it 's best to apply the CBD oil from the oral applicator onto a spoon , rather than applying the oil directly into your mouth from the syringe .
If you vape CBD , be sure to regularly wash your CBD vaporizers with isopropyl alcohol and do not share your vape pen with friends or family members .
