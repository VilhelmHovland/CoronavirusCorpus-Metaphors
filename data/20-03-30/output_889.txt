Surviving lockdown with young children  Child development expert Annette Henderson has some tips for working parents to cope at home while caring for school-age children .
The announcement we will all be in lockdown for a minimum of four weeks means those of us who are parents or caregivers of young children have the seemingly insurmountable task of figuring out how to take care of them , and ourselves , during this time .
Here are some tips for parents to consider as we move into this lockdown period :  Develop schedules and routines : Humans are creatures of habit and routines .
Indeed , research shows our sensitivity to regularities in our everyday lives is present very early in life .
When we can reliably predict what 's going to happen next , our learning is enhanced and our anxiety levels remain in check .
This is the same for adults and children alike .
As such , maintaining regular routines as best we can is one way we can feel in control of an otherwise largely uncontrollable situation .
Within the next day or so , get together with your family and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Ensure you include time for learning activities , self-care , chores , relaxation and most important , fun ! If you have school-aged children , teachers will be providing learning plans .
As parents , it 's important you do what you can to support your child 's learning environment .
If your child is not yet school age , engaging together in some structured tasks ( for example , drawing , colouring , crafts , etc ) will help fuel their developing mind .
While everyone 's learning habits are different , learning first thing in the morning might be the best way to get the day on track .
Making chores a fun family activity by harnessing your child 's inner ' prosociality ' -- that is , their behaviours that benefit or help other people : Many studies , including research conducted by our research group , have shown that children are prosocial beings .
Even before a child is two , they can share resources , help someone in need and work with others to attain shared goals .
Finding ways to use these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorten the days and ensure parents do n't have an entire house to clean once the children are in bed ! My sister , in lockdown in North America , shared with me what her and her family did the other day : they wrote down a bunch of household tasks on small pieces of paper and put them in a jar .
Every day , each person pulls out a task from the jar and then , after a bit of training from mum and dad , everyone went off and did their tasks ! I suggest adding in some fun music to really get into the cleaning spirit ! For those with quite young children who can not be left to their own devices , just give them a duster and chances are , they 'll follow you and lend their own little helping hands .
Children can play on their own and becoming bored is OK : Researchers have long argued that play is essential to children 's learning .
Parents do not need to be full-time entertainers for their children .
Providing children with opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment and hone their creative skills .
Free play also allows children the opportunity ( yes , opportunity ) to become bored , which is also OK .
In fact there are many positive outcomes associated with boredom .
Through boredom children learn how to regulate negative emotions that arise when they start to feel bored and learn how to " push through " by seeking out other things to occupy their attention .
Being able to cope with negative emotions gives them confidence that they can solve problems .
And lastly , when children experience boredom they get the space they need to use their imagination and form creative ways to entertain themselves .
Physical isolation does not mean social isolation : Humans are social beings .
We seek out new social experiences and become happy when they are found .
Being unable to leave home does not mean that you and your family can not have new social experiences , we just have to get creative with the form these new experiences take .
By taking advantage of video-conferencing technologies such as Skype , Google Hangouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrange " virtual " play dates with friends where the children lead the interaction .
you might be surprised how social children can actually be through a video-conferencing interface .
Parents might just need to help very young children figure out where the camera is ! For parents with older children , keep in mind peer relationships are critical to a child 's social , emotional and cognitive development .
Ensure your child has time and the space to connect with their friends .
Physical activity is important to maintaining health and wellbeing : Although we can not go to our local gym and our children can not go to their regular activities , it is important to keep our health and wellbeing in check by finding other ways to stay physically active .
There are many things you can do in your home to stay active as a family .
Check out YouTube for family exercise resources .
On the recommendation of my other sister , we tried Cosmic Yoga for Kids the other day , and it was awesome ! Playing hide-and-seek in the house is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house a few times .
And , an all-time fun activity when it rains - splash in puddles ! Fortunately , the weather in NZ is still relatively fine so take advantage and go for family walks or bicycle rides .
However , if you venture beyond your house , avoid contact with public surfaces ( e .
, no playground equipment please ! ) , remember to wash your hands with soap before and after you return and give others adequate space to respect social distancing .
Use digital media strategically : This is an unprecedented time and so parents might need to take some unprecedented measures to get through the next month or so .
If you are a parent who usually tries to limit your child 's exposure to digital technologies , this might be the time to relax some of these rules without feeling guilty about doing so .
However , I encourage parents use their child 's digital time strategically .
Think about the times of the day that are toughest to get through -- use digital technologies to make those times easier .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe it 's just before dinner and it 's been a very long day with everyone getting frustrated with one another .
Why not give your child some device time ? Ideally , this time should be family down-time in which parents and children are interacting with the device together .
But , again , if you need time for self-care or work , now is not the time to be hard on yourself -- this is a temporary situation that requires a few changes to rules so everyone can get through .
One last point , the internet has an abundance of great resources that will help over the next month or so .
Of course , there is also an abundance of not-so-great resources .
