Re : " Duffy neighbours stick together amid isolation " ( March 27 , p29 ) .
Is n't this gathering of neighbours , whether social distancing directives are adhered to or not , against the spirit , if not the letter , of the new regimen ? On Tuesday night the PM , when announcing enhanced restrictions , urged people not to gather outside .
He said " If you are gathering together in a group .
outside in a group , that 's not OK " .
I would urge Melissa Hingee to abandon " Caf ? Eildon " as it is clearly against the spirit , if not the letter , of the new restrictions .
If this endeavour , no matter how much it is considered worthwhile , is continued , we run the risk of even tighter sanctions .
That possibility should be avoided if at all possible .
Because of coronavirus Australia is experiencing a shortage of masks , gowns , ventilators , hospital beds , liquid soap , hand sanitiser , tissues , toilet paper ( why ? ) , and paper towels .
On the bright side , because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars so often , we 're not depleting our terribly low ( well under recommended and legislated levels ) of petrol and diesel fuel reserves .
I remember , 50 years ago as a " baby public servant " , going out to what is now the University of Canberra to learn about the dangers of incremental decision making .
That is making a series of small decisions in succession , each building on the last .
The danger is you risk " incrementalising yourself into a hole " .
I was also taught about the dangers of " groupthink " .
That is where groups develop their own thought processes and assumptions and fail to validate them adequately .
They then become isolated from reality .
I wonder why these long lost lessons have come back to me at this time ? The clear message from Steve Evans 's report " When will COVID-19 plague all be over ? " , March 27 , p2 ) is that the Morrison government must immediately give some clear and non-negotiable directions to Australians on measures to halt the spread of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow the lead of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern .
If Australians were to follow the path indicated by Professor Mikhail Prokopenko and his Sydney University team , and outlined in Mr Evans ' report , we may be able to conquer COVID-19 in three months .
This would require the entire population following tough , unambiguous , and consistent rules on social distancing and voluntary , or involuntary if necessary , isolation .
The cost of taking either path would be considerable .
However , it seems to me that the cost of the hard , three-month , path would be considerably less - especially in terms of the survival of small and medium-sized businesses and the welfare of casual or temporary workers - than letting the problem drag out for six months or more as flagged by our Prime Minister .
Mr Morrison must give firm , clear and consistent directions on COVID-19 as soon as possible .
I wish to pay tribute to Peter Dunn AO , the co-ordinator of the bushfire relief effort at Conjola .
He took time out to drive to Cooma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fires " .
He held everyone in rapt attention as he described how his community endured , first , fires on three sides and then , a month later , damaging floods .
The members of the Conjola community still badly need to put their arms around one another and recover , but now , coronavirus demands they do n't congregate in groups .
It takes man and women of great strength of character to endure all this .
Peter Dunn already has an AO but his holding his local community together needs to be recognised by the broader community .
I am sure there are other heroes from this Black Summer and beyond , but Peter Dunn is certainly one of them .
The economic interventions we are witnessing around the world are creating greater havoc than the coronavirus itself .
The lock-downs threaten the world 's economy .
We are living in a world in which the political leadership has lost its collective mind .
Without freedom of movement , productive jobs , incentives , savings and price discovery , little will remain for the citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations .
The world we have have known is over and the new world order that will replace it will be one of total control .
The authoritarians and the general public prefer to call it " patriotism " .
Rather than a vaccine against coronavirus we need one against politicians , bureaucrats and central bankers .
The latest promotional video of light rail Stage 2a ( Civic to Lake Burley Griffin ) does n't show the associated tram-funding property development along Commonwealth Avenue , and into West Basin .
It will ruin the important open-space character of the precinct , as well as the vistas to and from City Hill and environs .
If and when that expensive , disruptive , and heritage/environment destroying tram line goes further south , there 'll be more " land-value-capture " property development desecration in the National Triangle itself .
Better to go via Acton , an elegant new yacht-friendly tram/bike/pedestrian bridge , and Flynn Drive .
I 've been watching the re-stocking of goods like toilet paper , pasta , and even biscuits .
I noticed one interesting thing .
Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect the huge shortages of , say , toilet paper on the shelves are n't as much to do with everyone suddenly buying massive quantities but rather that Kleenex , a subsidiary of USA-based Kimberley-Clark , has been sourcing most of its product from overseas .
Quilton , an Australian brand , is manufactured locally .
The same goes for Arnotts and Nabisco in biscuits .
Once those international supply chains are cut we see the real dependence of Australian supermarket chains on cheap imports .
I hope this will bring home to some of our shoppers the importance of buying Australian and supporting Australian brands over cheap overseas products where the profits go off-shore .
If hoarding toilet paper is thought to be selfish , what about hoarding property ? One federal MP is said to own 10 properties .
One of our local MLAs owns four .
Such cashed-up buyers usually out-bid owner occupiers seeking the same property ( but without government assistance such as negative gearing ) .
The property hoarder then profiteers , in many cases , by renting back to those who would prefer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditch its political ideology and scrap the Public Service efficiency dividend so that Australians ( including conservatives ) can receive the level of support they need at this time ? Most importantly , when will they send some money ( economic stimulus ? ) to the ABC which , once again this year , is providing outstanding information to all of us ? For weeks we have witnessed our federal and state political leaders stumble along attempting to confront the coronavirus .
Now , partly through their ineffective , step-by-step measures , we are suffering a virtual lock down with all the inherent consequences of job loss , no income and restricted liberties .
Much of this was somewhat avoidable had significant , effective steps been taken weeks earlier .
Now many of us are facing six months of severe hardship .
Why are n't our politicians sharing in this pain ? For years federal government has sent boat people to places like Nauru and Manus Island to isolate them .
Now the governments have allowed infected people in when they should have closed our borders months ago .
This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past few days .
It is now too late to shut the stable door .
I note some insurers are declining to cover doctors ( and presumably other medical workers ) , who take out new policies , for COVID-19 .
I suggest the medical fraternity respond by choosing not to treat insurance company executives for the duration of the pandemic .
Most criticism of our leaders boils down to their failure to predict the unpredictable .
There really are " known unknowns " , and " unknown unknowns " too .
More sympathy for those making the hard calls is needed .
We can do without the carping and nitpicking .
Imagine what it must be like to have built your entire political reputation on stopping the boats and then failing to stop the one boat that actually mattered .
Just stop the boats ! Choose a course : Morrison 101 - " Chaos Theory and Application " .

Some blue stockings in academia are arguing for national restrictions on alcohol sales to remove the risk of outbreaks of violence .
My understanding of the national character leads me to believe such a ban would have the opposite effect to that intended .
Given the debate over supply of essential and non essential goods and services , it defies logic that cigarettes are choking up the supply chain .
This is an opportunity for people to kick the gaspers and keep us all safer .
After eight weeks of the virus I think it is time for the federal Health Minister to say which type of mask is the most effective in the judgement of medical authorities in Australia and overseas .
There is much discussion about how COVID-19 will affect landlords and tenants .
