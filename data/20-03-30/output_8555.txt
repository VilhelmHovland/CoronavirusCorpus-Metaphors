Escambia County Sheriff 's Office employee tests positive for COVID-19  The Florida Department of Health in Escambia County is working with the Escambia County Sheriff 's Office to determine anyone who may have come in contact with a process server who tested positive for the coronavirus over the weekend .
Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan told the News Journal that the process server has had " extremely limited contact " with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of its employees ' on-the-job activities and records their movements , Morgan said his agency can provide detailed information to Dr .
John Lanza , director of the county 's health department .
" We 're the ideal and the easiest investigation that Dr .
Lanza and his folks will do because we track our personnel , " Morgan said .
" We 've got excellent data on when he was at work , what he did and who -- and who he did n't -- have contact with .
Therefore , that will be cleared up quickly with Dr .
Lanza 's folks .
"  The county health department will utilize the ECSO records to determine how , when and where the process server possibly contributed to the spread of COVID-19 and inform any people who were potentially exposed .
" Those people that ( the process server ) made contact with will be asked or directed to go get the presumptive test , etc .
, " Morgan said .
" So it 's a procedure that we 're going to follow , just like everybody else .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news of a positive COVID-19 case within the ECSO could have on the agency , Morgan said he does n't think it has really sunken in yet since the case was only recently confirmed .
But Morgan made sure to note that an outpouring of support from the community has helped his deputies .
" The community is starting to really reach out to first responders , " he said .
" Not just us , but also to the fire department , police department , the EMTs , even medical personnel here .
"  Recently , the sheriff 's wife received a phone call from a citizen volunteering to sew homemade surgical masks for ECSO employees to wear while at work .
And no matter the number of future coronavirus cases that could arise in the future in his agency , Morgan said ECSO personnel would not be deterred from their duty to protect and serve .
" I think there 's a -- call it what you will , but -- just basically , a grim determination , " Morgan explained .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we do .
We 'll get through this just like we get through everything .
