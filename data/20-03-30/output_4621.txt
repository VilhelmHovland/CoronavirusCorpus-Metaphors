It 's easy to dwell on the dark side of human nature when you live online , confined as I am to my flat just in case I brought the virus back from Europe a week ago .
But it 's far better to rejoice in the signs of abundant goodness which are emerging as the cursed plague threatens to addle our minds .
Forget the selfish on Bondi beach or in the local supermarket .
Notice , instead , the countless quiet good deeds done by ordinary people .
Rejoice at the people on the balconies in France , Spain and Italy who sing to their neighbours in the apartments above and below .
Across courtyards , they pump accordions and bang tambourines and saucepans , raising their voices in unity and lifting the spirits .
Salute the Italian tenor who every evening serenades quarantined Florence , the most serene city with pestilence on the streets .
And the man in Toulouse who has run a marathon on his balcony a mere seven metres long - back and forth , I calculate , 6029 times .
But it 's not just defiant heroism on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very close to home .
All around us there are good people .
Here I sit in my cell , with another week of isolation to go , and food parcels just turn up on the step .
Colleagues have become friends .
The danger for me now is obesity from their roast chicken , cheese , cheesecake , biscuits , muffins , sausage stew , potatoes , more cheese , more biscuits , more calories .
I have had offers of food from strangers .
A person I met a year ago emailed to say : " If you are stuck for food please let me know and I can drop some off for you .
" ( She suggests a pet but I shall pass on that ) .
Small gestures go a long way in dark times .
A friend is now greeted with a " good morning " in the corridor of the apartment block where once chilly , unfriendly silence reigned .
At this paper , we are constantly told of gestures which lift the spirit .
Letters to the editor come in testifying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for toilet paper in vain on the shelves of the supermarket but when she got to the check-out some had been left for her : " The gentleman had taken it from his own trolley after he paid for it .
" READ MORE : A man told us a stranger came up to him and his wife in Aldi and said : " Here , take mine , we have enough at home to last a while .
" In Canberra , a mother and her daughter started a " street pantry " for the homeless - and others suddenly started keeping it well-stocked .
In this terrible time , it seems to me we need to rise and choose goodness .
It sounds pompous but it 's true .
It 's a choice , a decision .
Everybody enjoys a moan .
Social media gives us a great feeling of superiority over idiots fighting for toilet rolls .
But this virus in our midst has yet to wreak the damage it can and will do .
There may well be terrible choices if it ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blame those who refuse to keep their distance because they imagine it wo n't reach them .
But we should stick together .
Rejoice in new friends .
Get on a balcony and sing .
