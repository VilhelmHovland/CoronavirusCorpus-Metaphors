The director of development at Hong Kong-based fashion group PFGHL , which manufactures garments and textiles in factories based in Hong Kong and the mainland , was seeing business return to normal after an extended shutdown to stem the spread of Covid-19 in China following Chinese New Year .
Then , the virus hit western markets .
" That was going well for a little bit , but then very quickly Italy got hit , and then the US , " said Hui .
" Customers in the US are changing or holding orders , changing from air to sea shipment or cancelling orders altogether .
"  It 's a scenario playing out across fashion 's supply chain as the industry adjusts to the abrupt and devastating effect of Covid-19 's rapid spread .
Around the world , it 's hitting manufacturing with alarming force .
" It 's a bloodbath right now , " said Sanjeev Bahl , founder of Vietnam-based denim manufacturer Saitex .
" The buying community is taking the supply chain for granted and creating long-term collateral damage .
"  To make matters worse , many in fashion 's supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply and demand now compounded as a growing number of the industry 's manufacturing hubs fall victim to the virus ' spread .
In Italy , almost all factories have closed .
India , which is a major garment and textile manufacturer , went into lockdown last week .
Other countries are following .
It 's a bloodbath right now .
The impact of such shutdowns has been masked by the more immediate fallout from retail 's collapse , but it raises significant longer term questions about how the industry will recover .
" The disruption is now , but the effects will be really visible in the next months , " said Simone Cipriani , founder and chief executive of the UN 's Ethical Fashion Initiative , which connects marginalised artisan communities with international brands .
Demand Destruction  As retailers across western markets have closed one by one , the blow back on suppliers has been swift and devastating .
" I have received emails from clients just asking me to stop shipments , " said Mostafiz Uddin , managing director of Bangladesh-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers and take care of them .
How do I pay the raw material supplier ? "  Cut-and-sew manufacturers usually pre-order materials to fulfil customers ' demands , leaving them on the hook for substantial payments when orders are cancelled .
According to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association , or BGMEA , nearly $2 .
billion worth of orders had been cancelled or suspended across the country , one of the world 's biggest garment manufacturing hubs , by Monday .
" A prolonged epidemic will certainly worsen the situation further , " said BGMEA President Rubana Huq .
" Brands ' refusal to take the goods will cause us to have no recourse but to lay our factories off .
We are an export oriented industry totally dependent on export .
"  The impact has been felt on the luxury end of the market too , with factories across Italy seeing orders cut before they were shut down .
Now , suppliers are bracing to receive no payment for outstanding debts , said Danny d'Alessandro , general manager of Italian leather industry association Assopellettieri .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they approach their supply partners , seeking solutions that would allow both parties to survive the current turmoil , manufacturers said .
But many are simply cancelling orders , even if they have already been completed , leaving manufacturers and their employees in an extremely precarious position .
The blow back on suppliers has been swift and devastating .
" It 's very reckless behaviour , " said Bahl .
Brands and retailers are " creating shockwaves in the system by cancelling orders and not paying .
suppliers are being slammed with shotgun decisions .
" Saitex is currently working at a 25 percent reduced capacity .
By June , Bahl expects it to be down to 50 percent .
It 's a systemic shock taking place against a backdrop of looming longer-term economic pain .
UK retailer Primark said it would cancel all new orders , an extraordinary declaration that sent a clear signal the company is expecting a protracted and deep downturn .
" We have large quantities of existing stock in our stores , our depots and in transit , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we will be taking delivery of stock that we simply can not sell , " Primark Chief Executive Paul Marchant said in a statement .
" This is unprecedented action for unprecedented and frankly unimaginable times .
"  Primark has at least committed to paying for existing orders and provided its supply partners with clarity on its strategy .
But if other retailers follow suit , manufacturers are looking at a lost season at best .
" It 's the death knell for the industry , " said Bahl .
If there 's little or no production between July and September , " I do n't know what the hell will happen .
"  More worrying still is the prospect of a damaging wave of retail bankruptcies if things do n't pick up .
UK retailer Laura Ashley has already filed for administration as the fallout from the pandemic dealt its business a death blow .
And US luxury retailer Neiman Marcus is in talks with lenders , according to a Bloomberg report .
A wave of liquidations would leave manufacturers lumbered with huge amounts of bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will last and how many brands will go into Chapter 11 .
" That 's been our concern : we do n't know how long this will last and how many brands will go into Chapter 11 or Chapter 7 , " said Roger Lee , chief executive of apparel manufacturing giant TAL group .
If a retailer goes under with debts outstanding for garments under production , " that liability would kill most manufacturers .
"  A New Reality  Meanwhile , manufacturers are adjusting to new realities on the ground , as governments implement tough policies to contain the spread of the disease .
Uddin made the difficult decision to close his factory in Bangladesh Wednesday .
" My workers need to be safe , " he said , adding that his employees will receive paid leave through the closure .
So far , Bangladesh 's moves to contain the virus have left room for garment manufacturers to continue operating , though Huq said the BGMEA has now recommended all factories shut and most have done so .
While worker safety should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply chain .
Many manufacturers do n't have the balance sheet to support weeks or even months of labour costs with orders also getting cancelled .
Larger players are better placed to manage the costs , but the situation is still painful .
TAL Group 's factories in Malaysia are facing at least a four-week government mandated shut down .
The company will continue to pay all its 5,000 local employees .
Next week , it 's planning to close its production in Vietnam for seven days because of reduced order volumes , again maintaining payroll for its 8,000 employees on the ground .
Where manufacturers are allowed to continue to operate , it 's often with new constraints and regulations intended to protect workers .
In Africa , the Ethical Fashion Initiative 's partners have gone back to implementing processes last used when Ebola stalked the continent , including hand washing facilities everywhere and regular sanitation of all surfaces .
PFGHL 's factories now supply all employees with gloves and masks .
Shifts in the supply chain could cause more problems for vulnerable workers down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every person that enters the factory .
No outside visitors are allowed .
The facilities are disinfected every week , with toilets and common-use areas disinfected every day .
The company has also put in place counselling services and an education programme to encourage frequent hand washing and other preventative steps .
Many worry about the state of play elsewhere in the industry .
" Factories are a place where ventilation is often not good , work spaces are very close and goods need to pass from one workspace to another , " said Koen Oosterom , country manager for Bangladesh and Myanmar at nonprofit Fair Wear Foundation .
" It could be really disastrous .
"  A Precarious Lifeline  Things could get worse still .
The sharp dip in demand is hiding mounting pressure on fashion 's supply chains as countries close factories and borders .
The long-term impact is unpredictable , as closures and quarantines subject fashion 's complex and opaque networks to butterfly effect-disruptions .
" Supply chains are disrupted , and even if only one wing is disrupted all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Wherever we are , operations are disrupted .
"  In Afghanistan , where the initiative works with silk producers , exports have been delayed because of under-staffing at the customs office caused by illness .
Work in Eritrea has temporarily ground to a halt after the European overseers at the production facilities the initiative works with flew home amid mounting anxiety about the escalating crisis .
If e-commerce gets shut down , that is extremely scary .
With India in lockdown , " no work can be carried out either in sampling or in production , " said Vinod Dhawan , a factory owner and former president of India 's Garment Exporters Manufacturing Association .
" This has significantly affected current orders that are stuck in different stages of production , but also future collections which we should be sampling for .
"  Manufacturers in China that had been struggling to cope with the stresses caused by the country 's years-long trade war with the US may be at least temporary winners .
The country 's current success in beating back the virus has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other regions shut down .
" We 're trying to juggle the supply chain to bring back a lot of orders placed outside of China back into China , " said Yossi Nasser , chief executive at intimates manufacturer Gelmart .
Orders that are already placed with Bangladesh and India will go ahead , but the company is shifting new production programmes to open Chinese facilities .
Labour rights organisations worry that such shifts in the supply chain could cause more problems for vulnerable workers down the line .
Gelmart is working to ensure employees at its own operated facilities are protected and paid through any downturn .
" These employees are extremely crucial to us , " Nasser said .
Meanwhile , all-important logistics systems are under unprecedented pressure .
The wholesale cancellation of huge numbers of passenger flights has thrown into disarray the business of air freight , much of which travels in the hold of passenger planes , rather than on cargo jets .
Costs are escalating .
" The airlines have gone from lots of capacity to almost cargo-only capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing for Europe , the Middle East and Africa at Seko Logistics .
" That cargo-only capacity is in massive demand and prices are sky high .
"  Even e-commerce , which remains a lifeline for many retailers and a glimmer of hope for manufacturers , is under threat .
Efforts to ensure social distancing is enforced among the teams on the ground , and restricted hours to allow time for thorough and regular disinfecting , is slowing the pace at which packages can be processed .
Increased demand for essential items is being prioritised over more discretionary goods like apparel .
It 's increasing the cost to operate the supply chain .
" By and large , everyone 's seeing increased volumes and reduced capacity to operate safely , and as a consequence , some goods are pushed out to elongated delivery times , " said Zach Thommann , executive vice president and general manager at e-commerce solutions provider PFS .
" It 's increasing the cost to operate the supply chain .
"  Some companies have already made the decision to close their delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among those that have shut warehouses and halted deliveries .
Even luxury e-commerce giant Net-a-Porter has had to close distribution centres .
Few in the industry believe that everyone will make it out the other side of this crisis , but those that do are trying to ensure a more resilient future .
Companies are looking to the partners that are supporting them now , and seeking to build constructive ongoing relationships .
Many believe those who maintain transparent and open conversations now will be best-placed to hit the ground running when things stabilise again , while also giving their manufacturers the information they need to plan and manage their businesses effectively through the current turmoil .
" There 'll be customers that stopped everything , and customers making decisions now that recognise that when the market starts again , you 'll need goods and it takes months of planning and manufacturing , " said PFGHL 's Hui .
" Brands need to look into their supply chain and really talk to their suppliers and customers and really be transparent about the situation .
"  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result in a more responsible and ethical supply chain down the line .
The current crisis is throwing into even sharper relief long-standing issues , from poor buying practices to wasteful inventory management and bloated and opaque supply chains that leave companies blind to areas of risk .
Consumers are not stupid and they 'll reward companies with vision and leadership .
" At the moment brands are really in crisis mode of how do we immediately protect business continuity , " said Elisa Niemtzow , vice president at nonprofit consultancy BSR .
But " as we are in crisis mode , we also need to simultaneously be thinking about extended supply chains and how this will affect developing countries .
Very soon .
that will be everyone 's problem .
"  Niemtzow said brands should be carefully assessing their buying practices and making concerted effort to be as fair as possible .
Close partnerships with suppliers that allow companies to really understand how manufacturers and their employees may be affected , as well as any support local governments are putting into place , will be important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
For instance L'Or ? al has committed to shorten payment times to small business suppliers most exposed to the economic crisis caused by the pandemic .
" Consumers are not stupid and they 'll reward companies with vision and leadership , " Niemtzow said .
