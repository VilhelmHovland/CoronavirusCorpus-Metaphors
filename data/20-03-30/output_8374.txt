COSTELLO )  The posts have since been deleted and Pasola 's Facebook account appears to have been deactivated .
Block said he learned about the posts on Friday evening .
He said he has asked the Ocean County Prosecutor 's Office to determine if the posts violate the state 's anti-bias crime law .
Block said his own office will begin an internal investigation Monday .
In one image of a Facebook comment posted on the Scoop site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police breaking up various social gatherings that violated statewide restrictions for " social distancing " during the COVID-19 pandemic .
The post read : " Really , you 're asking why are they consistently breaking the guidelines set forth by the state of New Jersey ? The reason is because they think they are above the law .
Like I 've been saying for a while it 's time that the National Guard is deployed to that -- hole town and take action because nobody else is .
"  In another Facebook post , the Pasola account stated Lakewood " needs to be a hole in ( the ) ground " and referred to the township as " the filth of Ocean County .
"  Another post from the Pasola Facebook account came in response to a question about whether Point Pleasant Beach 's boardwalk , which is closed to the public as a social distancing measure , would remain off-limits this summer .
" Hope so , " the post from the Pasola account read , " keep the trash and Dirty ones from Lakewood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey Office of Agudath Israel of America , which advocates for the religious and civil rights of the Orthodox Jewish community , said the Lakewood Vaad -- the community 's council of leaders -- have called for Pasola 's dismissal .
" The deputy fire marshal is charged with protecting lives , " Schnall said .
" For one to spew such hate , what would happen if there was a fire in Lakewood ? His job is to protect the citizens of Lakewood .
We are the largest town in Ocean County .
"  Schnall said the comments were " shocking " coming from a first responder , because he said his own experience was that first responders are men and women who are " idealistic and of good faith .
"  " These are the leaders of a community , who go into their field because they want to help and protect people , " the rabbi said .
As of the weekend , Pasola was still an employee of the county government , Block said .
Murphy on Thursday condemned people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local Jewish community .
Murphy said some on social media have seized on incidents in which Lakewood residents have been charged for hosting weddings and other gatherings -- in violation of statewide restrictions -- to condemn the community as a whole .
The governor met with Jewish community leaders last Wednesday who expressed concern about anti-Semitism fueled by the outbreak .
" As chief law enforcement officer of Ocean County , it is my sworn duty to enforce the law and protect all of our residents , " Billhimer said in a prepared statement Friday night .
" To that end , employing a public health crisis and worldwide pandemic as an excuse to propagate hate and fear is unconscionable .
This behavior is contrary to law and will not be tolerated , " the statement continued .
" I am keenly aware these are extraordinarily stressful times , but that does not give anyone license to engage in violent behavior or threaten to commit violent acts .
The statements made by ( the suspect from Howell ) were not an exercise in free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values of a free and civilized society .
"  Schnall said he is not surprised by the surge in anti-Semitism .
Historically , in times of crisis or social upheaval , the Jewish people have always been used as scapegoats , he said .
" Anti-Semitism has always been around , it exists , we all know it exists , " Schnall said .
" Every synagogue and every school ( in Lakewood ) is closed .
I have n't been to my synagogue in two weeks .
"  Even the largest kosher grocery store in Lakewood limits the number of customers who may enter the store and the number of members from each family , he added .
The irony , Schnall asserted , is that Lakewood is doing more to enforce social distancing and in minimizing the spread of the virus than what the government requires .
" It is hurtful and it is shameful , " he said of the remarks posted on Pasola 's account .
@ @ Little Rock district continues at-home online classes amid outbreak  Little Rock Superintendent Mike Poore said Sunday that district students and teachers are to proceed today through Thursday this week with their previously developed paper and online school assignments .
District staff will follow up on Wednesday , Poore said , with plans for student lesson assignments to be used beginning Friday and on the following days in which the city and state 's school buildings are closed as a way to prevent the spread of the coronavirus .
Asa Hutchinson has directed that all public schools be closed to on-site instruction at least through April 17 and that alternative methods of instruction be used so that the school days wo n't have to be made up later in the year .
In a video message to parents on Sunday , Poore said that " Phase II " of the at-home instruction -- starting Friday -- will shift almost entirely to online instruction -- even for the elementary pupils who have been relying on worksheets and other on-paper lessons .
That shift to online lessons will necessitate the district to provide laptops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them to do their school work , Poore said .
Also in the video presentation , Poore said the district has an agreement to provide a child care program for Arkansas Children 's Hospital staff using school district staff who volunteer to provide the service at the hospital .
He said that will start with fewer than 15 school district staff .
Poore said the district is also talking to other area medical centers about providing child care or day camps for children of staff at those other medical centers .
