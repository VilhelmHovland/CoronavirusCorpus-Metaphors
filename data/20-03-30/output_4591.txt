When and how to get tested for coronavirus  You have returned from overseas in the past 14 days or spent time on a cruise ship , and you develop respiratory illness , with or without fever  You have been in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case in the past 14 days and you develop respiratory illness , with or without fever  You have severe community-acquired pneumonia and there is no clear cause ( including patients who have already been hospitalised for this condition )  You have a fever or acute respiratory infection and you work in the healthcare or aged/residential care sectors , or you have spent time in a location that 's defined by a state or territory as having an elevated risk of community transmission , or you have spent time at a " high-risk " location where there are two or more linked cases of COVID-19 , such as an aged care home , a remote Aboriginal community , a correctional facility , a boarding school , or a military base ( including Navy ships ) with live-in accommodation .

It 's operating 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
How long does coronavirus last on surfaces ?  Research published last week found the virus can survive for hours and in some cases days outside a host , depending on the type of surface it 's on .
Viable virus particles -- meaning they 're still able to infect you -- were detected for up to 72 hours on stainless steel and plastic surfaces , but no longer than 24 hours on cardboard , and four hours on copper .
Is coronavirus airborne ?  COVID-19 is thought to be mostly spread via respiratory droplets , the secretions we generate when we sneeze or cough .
When an infected person coughs or sneezes they spray out a shower of potentially hundreds or thousands of particles of various sizes .
The virus can spread when these droplets from an infected person land on objects or surfaces around them .
Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching surfaces infected with the virus , then touching their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into their respiratory system that way .
Researchers have found that when the virus is artificially turned into an aerosol , it remains viable for three hours .
The virus becomes an aerosol when particles remain suspended in the air as tiny droplets , five microns in diameter or less -- much smaller than the majority of the droplets you generate when you sneeze or cough  When will coronavirus stop ?  And that thing is whether individual Australians now follow official advice -- and just stay home .
Coronavirus will continue to spread virtually unchecked unless at least eight in 10 Australians stay home as much as possible .
That 's according to a new model created by the Centre for Complex Systems and the Marie Bashir Institute for Infectious Diseases and Biosecurity at Sydney University .
The researchers have built what is effectively a simulation of the entire Australian population using information about where everyone lives , the number of adults and children in each house , how people move around their town or city , and other details such as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benchtops and dining room tables around Australia have become workspaces as office workers have been advised to work from home in the face of the coronavirus pandemic .
Here are some tips and hacks that may help .
