Andrew Cuomo delivers his daily coronavirus briefing at the state Capitol ; March 26 , 2020 .
New York State Team  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from downstate communities hit hardest by the new coronavirus as the last resort , despite mounting concerns about New York City hospitals being overwhelmed in coming weeks .
" I 'm not eager to redistribute people from downstate to upstate , " he said during a press briefing Thursday .
" There 's just practical consequences : the family would have to travel further to visit them , etc .
, so that 's the last option , " he added .
His comments came as the Army Corps of Engineers and National Guard worked on turning convention centers and college dormitories into temporary hospitals throughout the greater New York City metro area , racing to prepare for the expected surge in coronavirus infections in coming weeks .
New York State authorities are considering using the Westchester County Center in White Plains , photographed March 22 , 2020 , to treat the expected rise in patients diagnosed with the Covid-19 virus in the coming weeks and months .

" Right now , the number of cases is highest in downstate New York , " Cuomo said Thursday .
" So we 're working on a collaboration where we distribute the load between downstate hospitals and upstate hospitals .
And we 're also working on increasing the capacity for upstate hospitals .
"  Yet beyond the major temporary hospital projects and military aid , Cuomo and state health officials have provided limited details about the logistics involved in transferring patients due to the outbreak , such as which ones would be given priority for staying local .
The state Department of Health on Friday would not answer questions about potential patient transfers related to the surge capacity planning , or provide documents related to the effort .
" We have received the required documents , we 're reviewing them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jill Montag , a Health Department spokeswoman .
Other hospital officials complained about a lack of protective gear for workers in New York City and across upstate , underscoring the uncertainty ahead as the outbreak front lines burn through increasingly scarce medical resources .
Latest plan to add more temporary hospitals in New York City  On Friday , Cuomo announced plans to build four additional temporary hospital sites to address the needs in New York City , which he said will allow the state to have one in each borough .
The sites were the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal , the Aqueduct Racetrack facility in Queens , CUNY Staten Island and the New York Expo Center in the Bronx .
They would add another 4,000 beds total .
Cuomo on Saturday said President Donald Trump approved the sites in order to begin construction as soon as possible .
The new sites would join the already finished temporary hospital at the Jacob K .
Javits Convention Center in Manhattan , as well as others being built at locations on Long Island at SUNY Stony Brook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plains .
The goal is to have the sites open to patients in early- to mid-April , Cuomo said .
The state is also preparing college dormitories and hotels across the downstate region , and identifying nursing homes and other facilities to serve as a place for emergency beds , he added .
On Saturday , Cuomo noted hospitals in each community should prepare plans to move patients and staff to other hospitals based on how the virus spreads statewide , citing the potential that clusters could pop up in different areas at varying times in coming weeks .
He added the decisions in part would fall to local hospital officials and health system administrators in the beginning to marshal regional resources , but state agencies and officials could eventually take over the process .
" There may come a point where the state steps in and actually allocates among local health systems , " Cuomo said .
