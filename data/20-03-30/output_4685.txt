" Virtually all football activity has now ceased for the foreseeable future because of COVID-19 , " Johnson said .
" These developments impact many forms of revenue for FFA , including national registration fees , broadcast fees , sponsorship , ticket sales and government funding , so we have needed to adjust our operations to ensure that we can remain operational .
"  It 's understood the decision could affect up to 160 people , with the federation directly employing 230 staff .
Johnson said a small number of staff would stay on during the pandemic to maintain operations and communication with the community .
" We view this as a temporary stoppage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be continually reviewing the situation and the impact of COVID-19 on grassroots football and the remainder of the Hyundai A-League season .
" We need a strong national governing body in place and a team ready and able to get back to work as soon as possible , as football will play an essential role in the recovery of our nation post COVID-19 .
"  Friday 's announcement did not mention whether executives would be following the example of the AFL by taking pay cuts or knocking back bonuses during the shutdown .
