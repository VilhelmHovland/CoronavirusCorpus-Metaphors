Congress did not give itself a raise in the coronavirus stimulus package  If Your Time is short  No version of the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security Act grants pay raises for members of Congress .
The House and Senate are slated to receive $35 million from the stimulus .
The money will go toward offsetting the costs of maintaining congressional law enforcement and child care staff , as well as improving teleworking capabilities .
The $2 trillion economic relief package that President Donald Trump signed March 27 is aimed at giving aid to Americans affected by the COVID-19 pandemic .
But some widely shared posts on Facebook claim the legislation helps Congress more than workers .
While the stimulus , officially known as the Coronavirus Aid , Relief , and Economic Security ( CARES ) Act , will dole out $1,200 checks to every adult making less than $75,000 per year , a March 26 post says the cash is pennies compared to the pay raise that legislators are giving themselves .
Another post , published March 20 , asserts that the House of Representatives voted to award its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to senior citizens .
A March 25 post is even more specific , claiming the congressional pay raise is on page 134 of the stimulus .
The posts were flagged as part of Facebook 's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed .

( Screenshot from Facebook )  The CARES Act is the largest economic relief bill in U .
history .
The legislation offers economic support in the form of small business loans , tax cuts , and health-related spending .
In addition to sending cash to everyday Americans , the law will give aid to the airline industry , which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic .
We 've seen alot of misinformation about the stimulus , so we wanted to look into these Facebook posts to see if there 's any truth to them .
Featured Fact-check  While the CARES Act does allocate money to some Capitol employees , there is nothing in the legislation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debunked the claim .
" The CARES Act does not provide either a pay raise or any funding for Member salaries , " said Evan Hollander , communications director for the House Appropriations Committee , in an email .
" Likewise , no version of the legislation -- House or Senate -- ever included provisions for a Member pay raise or funding for salaries .
"  We checked page 134 of the stimulus package as it appeared on March 25 , when one of the Facebook posts was published .
It contains information about grants given to states that have " short-time compensation programs , " which are alternatives to layoffs for employers that experience a reduction in available work .
Under the programs , employees who have their hours cut are permitted to collect a percentage of unemployment benefits to make up for lost wages .
The March 25 version of the CARES Act said nothing about pay increases for Congress .
Neither does the final version of the stimulus .
Hollander said there is $25 million in the stimulus to " support the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements to the network .
There is also money for reimbursing the staff of the House Child Care Center , covering the costs of food service contracts and paying the House sergeant-at-arms .
Meanwhile , the Senate is slated to get $10 million from the stimulus .
$1 million will go to the sergeant-at-arms to remain available for coronavirus response while $9 million will be reserved for " miscellaneous items , " including reimbursement for workers at the Senate Employee Child Care Center .
The Facebook posts are inaccurate and make a ridiculous claim .
We rate them Pants on Fire ! .
