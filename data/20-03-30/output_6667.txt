Pok ? mon GO continues to adapt to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic .
In addition to changes announced earlier this month , Niantic is also planning to let users partake in Raid Battles from home and more .
In a blog post today , Niantic has offered a handful of additional details on how Pok ? mon GO gameplay is adapting to COVID-19 and associated social distancing and shelter in place orders .
First off , the company says it is making improvements to Adventure Sync to better track indoor activity -- for instance , you can run on a treadmill and have that count towards in-game achievements :  You can track your steps indoor with Adventure Sync so activities like cleaning your house and running on a treadmill count toward game achievements .
We 're going to make improvements to Adventure Sync so it works even better with indoor movement and activities .
But perhaps most notably , Niantic says you 'll soon be able to participate in Raid Battles with other people , directly from the comfort of your own home :  We 're enhancing our in-game virtual social features to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in real life .
You 'll soon be able to team up with friends and take on Raid Battles together in Pok ? mon GO from the comfort of home .
