RANJITH SOYSA  Digressing from the plight brought about by the COVID 19 , I wish to draw the attention of your readers to an important item discussed in the Island , issue of 23rd March .
It was referring to the British High Commissioner who was said to be too busy to comment on his alleged intervention in the judicial process of Sri Lanka .
The former chief magistrate Mr .
Tilina Gmage under oath at the Presidential Commission stated that he received a letter from the British High Commissioner offering ' unsolicited advice ' in dealing with a case handled by him .
This is a serious matter which affects the rule of law , directly and indirectly , it is an act that violates the diplomatic rectitude .
On the other hand during a period when it became known that the NGOs , high profile ministers attempted to interfere in the judicial process , it is impossible to shake off simply the allegation against the British High Commissioner .
Some of the controversial statements issued by the Western embassies on governance in Sri Lanka during the period of the last government can be sited as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
It is indeed ironic to find that most of the advice contained in these statements wanted to fix our judiciary to redress the claims of ex-terrorists .
Oddly enough , one wonders whether COVID 19 is used as a convenient cover by the British High commissioner to run away from facing the issue .
In any case , now that the quarantine period is over , he should now come forward and explain his position clearly to the Government of Sri Lanka and the people of Sri Lanka .
While waiting for his explanation , we trust that Sri Lankan government too will raise this issue to seek clarification .
We hope that the High Commissioner will live up to the great British practices .
