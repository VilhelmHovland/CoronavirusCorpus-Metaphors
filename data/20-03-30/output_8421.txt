ACLU SUES TO REDUCE JAIL POPULATION  A petition filed with the state 's high court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania said tight inmate quarters , a lack of sanitation , and a limited ability to treat and quarantine people suspected of having COVID-19 presents an " extraordinary public health risk " to inmates , staff and surrounding communities .

Unemployment filings surged after Wolf first asked and later mandated that nonessential businesses close their physical locations .

It also expands eligibility to workers who do n't pay into the system and normally are n't eligible , but who lost jobs due to the pandemic .
