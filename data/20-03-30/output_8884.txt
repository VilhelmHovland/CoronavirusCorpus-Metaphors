The aggressive actions of local governments in the San Francisco Bay Area may have successfully bent the coronavirus curve .
" State leaders and doctors are cautiously optimistic that the Bay Area 's early moves to lock down residents two weeks ago have prevented surges of coronavirus patients from overwhelming the region 's health care capacity thus far , " Politico reported Monday .
" Six Bay Area counties were first in the country to adopt aggressive tactics with an enforceable March 16 order requiring residents to stay at home , " Politico noted .
" After 14 days -- the outermost period at which symptoms are believed to emerge post-infection -- doctors at area hospitals are now reporting fewer cases than they expected to see at this point , and officials credit the lockdown with stemming the tide of patients they feared would flood into emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's haphazard response to the COVID-19 pandemic were revealed in a bombshell new report published by The Atlantic on Monday evening .
" On March 13 , President Donald Trump promised Americans they would soon be able to access a new website that would ask them about their symptoms and direct them to nearby coronavirus testing sites .
He said Google was helping .
That was n't true , " The Atlanticreported .
Al Gore explains why Trump is flailing : ' You ca n't gaslight a virus '  Former Vice President Al Gore explained why President Donald Trump was failing in his response to coronavirus during a Monday evening interview with CNN 's Don Lemon .
Gore explained he feels , " especially badly for those who really follow President Trump and believe in him , and , you know , there are quite a few people in our country that do .
"  " I do n't agree with his policies , but those who follow him , I 'm afraid many of them have been misled into thinking that some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it in a specialized way -- but saying it was going to disappear , those kinds of things , I feel badly for those who believe that stuff and have not been protecting themselves , " he explained .

Just over a month after proclaiming that the number of coronavirus cases in the United States would soon " be down to close to zero , " President Donald Trump said during a press briefing on the White House lawn Sunday that limiting U .
deaths from the pandemic to between 100,000 to 200,000 people would mean his administration and the country as a whole did " a very good job .
"  Speaking as the death toll from the novel coronavirus climbed above 2,300 in the U .
-- which has the most confirmed cases of the virus in the world -- Trump cited recent research warning that 2 .
million people in the U .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population take no action to mitigate the threat .

million deaths , 2 .
million people from this , " the president said .
" And so , if we can hold that down , as we 're saying , to 100,000 -- that 's a horrible number -- maybe even less , but to 100,000 , so we have between 100- and 200,000 , we all together have done a very good job .
"  Critics condemned Trump 's remarks as remarkably cruel and callous , particularly coming from someone who has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the virus -- at one point suggesting it was a " new hoax " perpetrated by the Democratic Party -- and urged Americans to get back to work despite warnings from medical professionals .
" There really are no words for this level of insensitivity and inhumanity .
A serial killer would be jealous , " said Charles Idelson of National Nurses United in response to Trump 's comments .
Others reacted with similar alarm and disgust :  Advertisement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would soon be zero coronavirus cases in the United States .
Now he 's saying he will claim victory if 100,000 Americans die .

Trump announced Sunday that the White House is extending federal social distancing guidelines to at least April 30 , a retreat from the president 's insistence last week that the country could be " rarin ' to go " by Easter -- April 12 .
