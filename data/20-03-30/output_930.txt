" My hometown in the news , " I tweeted on Jan .
15 , with a screenshot from an article about a new SARS-like virus found in China .
It was a sardonic reference to my hometown , Wuhan , a city that almost no one in America had ever heard of , even though its population exceeds that of our biggest metropolis .
As a kid answering the question of where I was from , I wished that people would know the name Wuhan the same way they knew about Beijing , Shanghai , Hong Kong .
January was before the makeshift hospitals , before the martyring of a whistle-blower doctor , before nearly 800 million people were placed under lockdown , before the virus started spreading in earnest beyond Chinese borders .
Now it 's late March , and people the world over are panicking as country after country shuts down .
But for those like me -- members of the Wuhan diaspora living in the United States -- the daily headlines and panic come with a sense of d ? j ? vu .
We 're living through the coronavirus outbreak twice : first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach our lives directly .
Watching the recent events in America is " reopening the experience of grief that I felt when I was looking at it happening in Wuhan , " says Rui Zhong , a China analyst at the Wilson Center in Washington .
Zhong , like me , was born in Wuhan and moved to the United States around age 5 .
All of her grandparents are quarantined there , unable to go outside for the past two months ; one aunt works at a hospital and has a pass to go to and from work .
For a long time , it seemed that everyone in the U .
treated COVID-19 as an abstract foreign policy issue , Zhong says .
As she puts it , the usual reaction would be that the outbreak was really unfortunate , " now let 's talk about movies next weekend .
" Even a few weeks ago , when the Wilson Center was ordering its employees to work from home , one co-worker wondered whether the move was an overreaction .
But Zhong 's family 's experience in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary .
Ivy Yang agrees about the seeming lack of urgency in the States .
Yang , who is studying for her masters at Columbia Business School , was born in Wuhan and came to the U .
when she was 9 .
Last Christmas , her parents came from Wuhan to visit , but were unable to return because of the lockdown .
Stuck in the U .
, the entire family decamped to a place in New Jersey .
" In New York , it was a very slow ramp-up and then it kind of hit in a very extreme way , but for Wuhanese living in New York , we were always very vigilant , " she says .
Long before official warnings began to proliferate , Yang was avoiding public transportation and large events , telling non-Asian about the importance of hand hygiene and explaining why people were wearing masks .
Two weeks before the schools officially closed , she pulled her 6-year-old son out of first grade .
" A part of me just did n't believe that , given how much traveling there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case , " she says .
" The last flight out of Wuhan was on the 23rd of January , and I remember just counting the days -- 14 days from Jan .
23 -- and thinking that if anything happened it would be during that duration .
"  I was not nearly as careful as Yang .
When my father ( in California ) called in January to say that he was canceling his back trip to Wuhan out of fear of being quarantined , I thought he was being paranoid .
I had never heard of an entire city being quarantined before .
He relayed rumors that the situation was much worse than reported in either Chinese- or English-language media , but I merely told him to stop calling the virus " SARS " and said that misinformation was very common on social media .
In February , we received news that a relative in Hubei , my mother 's cousin , had died from the coronavirus .
Soon , I was hearing stories about how only one member of our family could go outside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his parents , away from his wife who was quarantined with my cousins -- was learning to cook out of necessity .
Still , it was n't until the virus hit Italy that I realized that it would not be contained and that I should start staying indoors .
If it could reach southern Europe , there was little reason it would not reach the United States .
Even then , I had envisioned a slow rollout , not an entirely new state of affairs within two weeks .
Similarly , the spread of Covid-19 came as a surprise and a disappointment for Zeyi Yang ( no relation to Ivy ) , who came to New York City from Wuhan to pursue graduate studies at Columbia .
" This whole of January and February , I always thought this was a tragedy for my hometown , " he says .
" I did n't know my life in New York was going to be impacted .
It 's caught me unprepared .
"  Zeyi remembers seeing the World Health Organization refuse to declare a pandemic and hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct precautions .
" There are a lot of things that the Chinese government did n't do well when they were handling the crisis , and I secretly thought if this was happening in another country , it would be different , " he says .
He did n't expect other countries to make the same mistakes .
For all of us with family back in Hubei , the conversations have changed in recent weeks .
I still ask my family about how they are doing , but , now , they are worried about my hygiene and the dangerous hotspot of Brooklyn .
They say that New York is the new Wuhan .
Once , Zhong mostly asked after her grandparents ; now they give her advice about sanitizing packages and wearing gloves and tell her to take a shower whenever she gets home .
Yang has gone from coordinating with extended family to get food to her grandparents ( who live in an 18th-floor apartment ) to receiving inquiries from Chinese friends who ask if she 's OK and whether she needs masks .
Friends did end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police department .
Zeyi 's parents call frequently to make sure he 's not going outside , and his mom also warns him to exercise during this time so he does n't gain weight during quarantine like she did .
The whiplash from the change in fortune is surreal .
Zeyi 's mom , a human resources manager , has returned to work .
Meanwhile , all his classes are online , his research trip to Nepal has been canceled , and Columbia 's journalism career fair is virtual now , with many attendees pulling out .
" I 've been staying at home for two weeks except for one or two grocery trips , " he says .
" I already feel like this is so unbearable , like I do n't know how I can cope for the next month or two months .
my parents have already done this for two months .
I can do it , I 'm just not sure how to .
"  My wish that people know the name of Wuhan was granted , though it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zhong , too , says that when news of the virus first started to spread , she became dejected thinking that people would associate our hometown " with this horrible illness forever .
"  She wants people to remember Wuhan for other things -- for what Zhong calls its " Midwest part of China energy , " its riverside Rust Belt-like history , its love of carbs , its down-to-earth accent .
Yang , too , wants people to know Wuhan for more than the virus and even for more than landmarks like the Yellow Crane Tower , which is widely regarded as a symbol of the city but is the kind of place that locals usually never go to unless you have friends in town .
( See : Times Square .
) Yang is working with artists in Wuhan on an initiative called the Reboot Project to showcase different aspects of the city : the foodie culture and breakfast delicacies , the punk music scene , the business potential , anything but bat soup and disease .
As for me , I bite my tongue now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can .
I do n't roll my eyes when my dad keeps shipping me plastic gloves , or preach about misinformation when I receive texts about how the mail might have coronavirus so I should try to sanitize everything before opening .
In January , I was arrogant , but I was proven wrong .
In April , as my grandparents are able to go outside again and I 'm staying six feet away from everyone , I will be glad that the worst is over for them and ask for their advice when I need it .
