Cash is king .
This is a common phrase heard particularly in times of market stress , but long term investors will well know that in the long run , cash as an asset class is all but certain to underperform other asset classes such as equities and bonds .
Unfortunately , what we believe lies ahead in global financial markets means that investor 's cash purchasing power is likely going to deteriorate even further .
In this note , we will discuss some risks ( maybe some that investors have n't thought about before ) that could destroy their precious cash !  Most investors have a recency bias where they think what has been , will continue .
We believe we are now at a critical juncture where major fundamental changes are occurring in financial markets .
The Coronavirus is just the pin that is bursting what was one of the biggest asset bubbles in history .
As a result of the unprecedented slow down across global economies , central banks and policy markets are going to respond with a significant money printing in order to stimulate and help the economy through the shutdowns .
Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This means that the purchasing value of a dollar today is about to deteriorate significantly .
What lies ahead , we believe is stagflation ( inflation or prices rising on goods needed for living while unemployment remains high and growth stagnates ) .
This inflation is already being seen in supermarkets as people comment about prices rising on goods in high demand .
The panic buying and increased demand for consumables right at the time supply chains have been decimated ( due to the shutdowns ) is resulting in prices rising for everyday goods .
If $100 could buy you a week 's worth of food , it might now only be buying 6 days worth due to price rises .
and maybe even less in the future .
Right now in many countries governments and central banks are about to implement " helicopter money " literally giving cash payments to citizens in order to stimulate the economy .
As everyone begins to receive payments in order to supplement their lost incomes they now no longer have due to the shutdown , they will focus on spending this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already in high demand ) .
This further exacerbates the problem of stagflation as they continue to be unemployed yet prices for consumable goods rise .
The pressures then begin on the monetary system as endlessly money printing increases the money supply - likely resulting in further erosion of purchasing power .
As more money becomes available the purchasing power of that money is further reduced depending on the level of inflation .
Now perhaps counterintuitively , in periods of higher inflation , it is better to own physical assets to protect against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation .
A recent example is Venezuela , where extreme hyperinflation decimated their economy .
While we do n't expect this to happen in the western world , it is an example to show how the stock market performed over this period .
However , when you look at the same performance in US Dollars as opposed to the local currency - the return profile is much different !  Currency debasement and stagflation are probably two of the most difficult periods for investors to navigate .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is potentially the next asset class to be eroded .
or taken .
Another threat to investor 's precious capital is the economic fall out from the coronavirus .
As we discussed in our recent video presentation all crisis escalate with a banking crisis .
Now if inflation returns right at the same time unemployment rises to unprecedented levels it 's going to have some terrible outcomes .
Not only is the purchasing power of money deteriorating , but more and more people begin defaulting on debts .
Being a debtor ( lender/bank ) in a higher period of inflation is not good business ( especially if rates are fixed ) .
This is because the amount owed remains fixed , while the value of that money deteriorates .
The only way banks combat this is by lifting interest rates ( which will have serious economic ramifications ) in order to try to keep pace with the devaluation and entice depositors to keep cash on deposit instead of taking it out or buying assets with it .
The second part of higher defaults mean banks become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are willing to lend credit .
While banks always say they do n't want to foreclose on people , they typically do n't get much choice when things get nasty .
While the Australian government guarantees deposit 's up to $250k ( and this wo n't change in our view ) it certainly does n't mean figures above this amount are n't at risk .
While most people know what a bail-out is .
Not many know what a bail-in is .
This is where banks ( should they get into financial trouble ) can bail-in deposits over and above the $250k amount in order to recapitalise the bank 's balance sheet .
Depending on the severity of the balance sheet and level of bad debts from the economic fallout , this could mean a significant haircut to investors ' safe ' cash held on deposit .
In a period where the wealth gap between classes is at extremes .
It is likely to create further tensions should a banking crisis ensue .
Politically , it may also seem like a better option that the wealthy help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could lie ahead ( in the form of a bail-in ) as governments struggle with massive budget deficits and are unable to bail out the banking sector .
So can Australian banks really fail ? Well , as recent as 2008 , Bankwest teetered on collapse before being acquired by Commonwealth Bank .
In Australia 's last recession in the early 1990s ( yes , Australia has had a recession before ) , a slew of financial institutions collapsed ( State Bank of Victoria , State Bank of South Australia , Pyramid Building Society to name a few ) .
Depositors were fortunate that the Government recompensed them in these collapses , but that is not always a given .
In the 2013 Bank of Cyprus depositor bail-in , depositors with more than ? 100,000 lost almost half their money and were recompensed with unwanted equity .
In the aftermath of the GFC , excessive borrowing at cheap rates led to the Greek debt crisis when debts could no longer be repaid .
This led to a run on Greek banks , out of fear of a potential bail-in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a potential exit out of the euro , nobody wanted to hold cash ; depositors rushed to withdraw cash out of banks and purchased anything tangible that could hold its value .
We are not trying to fearmonger our readers , but rather pointing out that complacency along with unprecedented global events could lead to a number of unexpected outcomes .
Cash in the bank is perhaps not as risk-free as you may think ( right at the time most investors are running to cash ) .
We believe that what lies ahead is going to be an extremely difficult market for the average investor .
Those who do n't understand counterparty risk , who ca n't invest globally and that ca n't short sell are going to struggle in the years ahead .
Unfortunately , most investors do n't seem to be seeing the big picture .
Perhaps this time of self-isolation is important to get clarity on what the future might hold and to review your own positioning .
Most investors do n't seem to have much exposure to assets or managers who will do well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we would like to think we are in that category !  Adam Watt 30th March , 2020  Given that your property is n't even safe in Australia , I lost mine in a compulsory acquisition For a fraction of market value and then the banking bailin laws being enacted I was glad to transfer all assets including business , cash and assets out of Australia to a safe country , I was fortunate to sell my last property before the risk factors changed things , you really have to be crazy to keep assets in countries like Australia , another law that may me re-introduced is the gold confiscation , that might be one to watch .
Matt Daniell 30th March , 2020  Thanks Scott , interesting , and helpful advice .
I assume you 'd need to own assets - that are useful and not necessarily ones you would want to redeem for cash ( like shares ) .
until there is a new currency accord or whatever they 'll do - whoever they are ? There might be a global serfdom ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there .
Mark Dawson 30th March , 2020  If there 's going to be a run on the banks like there has been on supermarket toilet paper then we 're in for some big trouble .
Like you say cash is not king and cash is going to be worth even less in the future .
Gold is where you want to be .
Some of our gold producers are currently looking cheap so start there and if you 're really safety conscious then purchase pysical gold .
