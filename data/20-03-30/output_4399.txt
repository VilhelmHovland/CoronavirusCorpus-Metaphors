The Surprising Way Flu Vaccines Can Help Fight COVID-19  South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has announced that the flu vaccine will begin to be rationed , this is according to Business Insider .
The flu vaccine is designed to combat multiple strains of the ever-mutating common influenza virus and is updated annually to keep up with the latest strains .
In terms of the novel coronavirus , this vaccine is entirely ineffective .
However , those who have access to or are given the flu vaccine may be able to keep additional pressures off South Africa 's health system .
Beds full of patients ill with the flu can be emptied by this vaccine , allowing additional capacity for patients with the novel coronavirus .
Mhkize 's rationing is in part to prioritize healthcare workers in the country , now at the front lines of the pandemic .
The minister says that South Africa has received limited stock of the flu vaccine as the coronavirus pandemic was n't anticipated when orders were placed a year ago .
" This is precipitated by the fact that the country can not afford to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mkhize says .
" This is one of the major lessons that we have learned from countries that have experienced the COVID-19 pandemic .
"  Professor Wolfgang Preiser , Medical Virology division head at the University of Stellenbosch , says the flu vaccine should be given especially to people in high-risk groups -- children younger than 3 and adults older than 65 .
People within the high-risks brackets can suffer serious consequences if they get both the coronavirus and the flu , Preiser told Business Insider .
Further , Guy Richards , Critical Care professor at the University of Witswatersrand , says that getting the flu vaccine can help clear confusion between the flu and COVID-19 as they have similar symptoms at the onset .
This could allow for a doctor or medical practitioner to understand whether they have the coronavirus or not .
" It has no side effects .
It can not cause ' flu ' or a cold and the most you can get is a sore arm at the site of the injection , responsive to Panado , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  5 Things Businesses should look out for Post Pandemic  The global COVID-19 pandemic has made its presence felt in South African retail and consumer-focused businesses , especially in tourism and hospitality , but the full impact on earnings , cash flow , and employment will last far longer than a three-week lockdown .
With the 21-day nationwide lockdown in place , the full effects will now ripple through all sectors and industries at least until the end of this year -- in an " economic cycle like no other we have ever seen " , says University of Stellenbosch Business School ( USB ) guest lecturer in corporate and development finance , Jason Hamilton .
Hamilton , a director at First River Capital , says with the South African economy already under severe pressure -- the SA Reserve Bank ( SARB ) having revised its GDP forecast down to 0 .
for 2020 -- it was expected that the impact of slowed-down global growth ( expected to contract by 2 .
) due to the pandemic would see South Africa 's GDP retracting by between 2 .
to 3 .
with some models estimating up to 5% .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday would result in further outflows which the country can ill afford , he says , and the cost of debt would increase .
" Up to the lockdown businesses were able to trade and generate some earnings to keep the lights on , keeping employees employed and earning some level of income .
A total lockdown will bring significant retrenchments across all sectors and industries , with cash flow and earnings under threat in businesses of all sizes .
" It is also looking likely that some form of control and restrictive measures will remain in place for months to come , which means we will be dealing with this until the end of the year -- even if we look to China , which now has a flattening curve , they are more than five months into the battle against the disease while trying to keep their economy alive , " Hamilton says .
Data from the last 11 global recessions indicate that it takes on average a year-and-a-half for the economy to start recovering , but the current economic cycle is unlike any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have traded through them , and the average of 18 months to the start of recovery in theory gives us a timeline to follow .
But the market sell-offs and economic cycle ( reduced GDP growth or recession ) we are busy entering is based on an event , not on fundamentals or underlying economic systems issues , which means it 's very difficult to predict how long and how impactful it will be .
" What we can , however , focus on is that it is event-driven and hence the recovery and comeback should be quick , the question is just when , " says Hamilton .
Interest rates -- room to move  Unlike many developed economies where interest rates are already close to zero , Hamilton says it was positive that the SARB still had " significant room to provide support of at least 300 basis points " even after the repo rate was lowered by 100 basis points , as the inflation outlook remains within the target midpoint .
" We have seen significant cuts in short succession from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc .
) acting very quickly , which further supports the view that South Africa has further room and drastic action can and should be taken .
The balancing act is , however , on inflation targeting and the exchange rate , " he says .
Access to liquidity will be key in the months ahead which would require direct action from the government .
" Credit will need to be extended and/or restructured to individuals and companies to bridge cash flows as the trading environment tightens or , as in the case of a lockdown , grinds to a halt for many industries .
This will require support from the government , and the announcement by President Cyril Ramaphosa of the first phase of these is to be welcomed .

Government &amp; business support welcomed  A tax system ready assist firms with liquidity at the employee level by fast-tracking claims and reimbursements and to delay up to 20% of PAYE for smaller businesses , was a positive move that would assist business -- and recommended that further stimulus could come from deferment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher percentage of PAYE deferred .
" The clear focus on SMEs and vulnerable sectors like the informal sector , with the establishment of the independent Solidarity Fund , will support the public sector 's efforts and it is hoped that large businesses will follow the lead of the Rupert and Oppenheimer families which have allocated R1-billion each to the support initiatives , " he says .
Banks have indicated their commitment to the national efforts and Hamilton says this would entail a case-by-case restructuring of loans , likely through payment holidays or deferments to assist companies ( and individuals ) with three to six months ' grace to improve the underlying cash flows .
" This has been made slightly easier through relaxed regulatory requirements to free up headroom from a capital holding point of view .
"  " Last week we saw the SARB taking further action to provide liquidity to the market through an active bond-buying programme announced and increasing its refinancing operations to 3 months , and it 's likely that we will shortly see longer tenors on the offer of 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Highlighting the knock-on effect of the economic challenges , he says further clarity would be needed in the real estate sector , as landlords would need the support of their funders or backers if they are to assist tenants with rent moratoriums .
Similarly , some firms might be able to approach their insurance companies with claims for loss of income , although this will in turn place the insurance companies under threat and likely facing liquidity concerns themselves .
National finances  With South Africa 's budget deficit projected to be just under 7% of GDP by 2021 , the national finances are already under great pressure , Hamilton says .
Moody 's previously hinted towards giving South Africa time to recover , however , any runway is now gone with the impact of the pandemic felt globally , and as such on Friday they downgraded the country to below investment grade ( Ba1 ) and maintained a negative outlook .
" A downgrade will result in further outflows which we do n't need right now , with foreign investors selling more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of the year , which is double that seen during the 2008 financial crisis .
"  There is a slight reprieve , he states , in that the other ratings agencies have since 2017 rated South Africa as junk , which has seen investors price and treat the country as such since then , which has come through in the spreads of the credit default swap ( CDS ) markets .
" Although with this downgrade the debt cost will increase , " Hamilton says .
The government remained in a difficult position with a projected 6 .
GDP deficit , about R370bn , to address , and " now also a stimulus package required to limit or soften the blow of the COVID-19 pandemic " .
" Moody 's in its statement reviewed this number up to 8 .
although in my view it will likely be at 10% , which means SA will over the medium term require much higher debt levels than previously modeled and for much longer , " he says .
Although economies around the globe have made available funds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unlikely that South Africa would require the upper limit of such stimulus -- " but this still implies a need of between R80 billion to R170 billion " .
" The impact will be felt but most of these funds could be sourced from within the current budget through reallocation of non-essential or non-critical spending .
Yes , there is an element of borrowing from the future in this strategy , but current circumstances require drastic action , this is also in line with what we are seeing globally .

Economic sector outlook  Accommodation and travel booking cancellations are the " first wave " of the impact on the tourism sector , with effects now moving into the hospitality sector , such as restaurants , bars and coffee shops .
The manufacturing sector has seen some factories close and Hamilton says it was likely that many would retool to assist with the manufacturing of medical equipment .
" The agricultural sector is a key driver of the economy and very reliant on international trade , as they are in the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although , with all the markets globally also facing a recession or lockdown , luxury agricultural products will suffer while staple foods are set to show more resilience , " he states .
Consumer-focused businesses will remain attractive for investors , Hamilton predicts , with those that have adopted online strategies " likely to weather the storm successfully as they have managed to adapt or pivot quickly in the response to the crisis and are best placed for what might be a big shift in buying behaviour post the pandemic " .
The key growth driver has been the Business and Financial Services sector and as they are also positioned to service clients remotely , they are likely poised to be able to bounce back quickly .
" The only sectors that will not be affected , or suffer the least damage , will be the essential service providers , being the food suppliers , food and medical supply chains and medical support providers , " he says .
No sector is immune to the impact and fall out of the crisis and survival has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hence firms with net debt to EBITDA of less than one and healthy pre-crisis operating margins are best placed to navigate the next few months successfully .
Investors  How investors will navigate this crisis from an investment and cash flow management point of view is also an important consideration .
There are significant amounts of capital allocated for new and follow-on investments -- available capital sums are at historic highs .
" This also suggests that investors in SME 's and other private businesses , and the listed space as well , have the ability to inject further funds through debt and equity packages into investee companies to support and navigate the coming months , " Hamilton states .
This will have a lasting impact on the companies ' finance and potentially their shareholding structures , as any equity raised or injected will come with very specific conditions .
Some of the development finance institutions ( DFIs ) active on the continent had specifically stated their support to investee companies in ensuring employees can be supported through these times .
Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade and Industry have allocated $168-million ( R3-billion ) for specific investments in critical businesses , with applications to be fast-tracked .
Hamilton concludes that " 2020 is viewed as a lost year for many but we also have to look back in history and see what has been overcome before .
"  " It is up to all of us , the people and nation of South Africa , to unite and jointly fight this pandemic and with government , business and the public aligned we .
