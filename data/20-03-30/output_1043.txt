Advertisement  Superintendent Paul McCurry who is leading South Yorkshire Police 's response to Covid-19 has issued this message to victims of domestic abuse :  We know this is a time of worry for all of us but this may be heightened for those who have suffered or are suffering domestic abuse in any of its forms .
The isolation period , in most cases , will mean that you have little to no respite from your abuser and you may be concerned that your reporting mechanisms are now limited .
I want to offer you some reassurance .
" I 'm writing this to let you know we are here for you and will remain here for you throughout .
We have the resources to support you and we will take your report seriously .
" One of your concerns may be the ways in which you will contact us should something occur .
999 is available for all emergencies and I want to remind you of our silent solutions .
If you ring 999 and are not in a safe position to speak just press ' 55 ' .
This will notify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
Our staff will listen , and make an assessment of your situation based on what they can hear in the background so we can get the right response to you  " If you are concerned and would prefer not to speak to the police , you could use one of the many charities offering support , these include Womens Aid who hold a web chat between 10am and noon ( Monday to Friday ) ; the 24 hour National Domestic Abuse Helpline 0808 2000 247 , Mankind or Galop ( specialising in LGBT+ who have a phone line available between 10 to 5pm ) or Karma Nirvana who have support lines available between 9am and 5pm Monday to Friday on 0800 599 9247 .
" If you do require our support but are worried that we will leave your abuser isolated with you after an incident , I want to tell you about Domestic Violence Protection Orders .
These are orders we can secure through the court within 48 hours .
" The order , if granted , can have a number of provisions including preventing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
This should give you the necessary respite and allow you time to put longer term plans in place .
You might be reading lots about backlogs with the courts but DVPOs are handled differently and are still available to us .
" You may also be concerned about where your abuser would go if they were not allowed home during the COVID isolation period .
We will look for alternative accommodation for them , possibly with friends or family or emergency accommodation .
" I hope this information has provided you with a little peace .
We are here for you and will remain here for you throughout .
"  -- Superintendent Paul McCurry  What 's the Independent Domestic Abuse Service doing ? The IDAS are extending their online Live Chat service in response to a 30% increase in chats for March 2020 from the same month last year .
The increase has been attributed to concerns about people being isolated with an abusive partner or family member as a result of the global pandemic .
