#Covid-19 : Here 's why Irish people are doing push-ups to support healthcare workers  " They say ' your health is your wealth ' but this applies to an entire nation .
"  A new campaign has been launched in aid of Ireland 's healthcare workers - and the key to supporting it is by being active .
The Push-Up Challenge is encouraging people to get their biceps out to support those working the frontlines of the Covid-19 outbreak , both physically and mentally .
Started by Emma Coffey Nguyen , the campaign is raising vital funds for mental health services and ICU equipment for the Mater Hospital and Mercy University Hospital Cork - all the while encouraging people to keep active in self-isolation .
Emmy tells Her that while the government are preparing for the influx of new patients the coronavirus will undoubtedly trigger , hospitals , doctors , and nurses are going to need all the support they can get during the pandemic .
Having worked with UNICEF and visited Sierra Leone in the past , Emmy knows first hand the effects pandemics can have on healthcare workers and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch with her uncle who is in the ambulance service and a friend who is a trainee doctor to see what she could do to help .
" After speaking with them and doing additional research I knew I had to do something , even if it was from my living room , " she says .
" As an athlete , I knew it would be important to stay on top of training and keep mentally strong too .
And thus , the Push-Up Challenge was born .
"  The idea for the challenge is simple : film yourself doing as many push-ups as possible from the comfort of your home , nominate three friends to do the same , post the video with the hashtag #thepushupchallengeIRE , and donate what you can to the cause .
The challenge has already raised almost ? 3,000 for both hospitals , with more donations ( and more push up videos ) appearing by the day .
Emmy says that she did n't expect the campaign to get as much traction as it has - but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely want to help and do something during this confusing time , " she says .
" It 's been really heartwarming to see .
" My gran has even got involved .
Her questionable push-up involves lifting a packet of Cadbury mini-rolls over her head ! It 's made me incredibly proud to be Irish seeing people pull together .
"  But despite the positive response during this tough and uncertain time , Emmy says that it is going to be an " exceptionally difficult " few weeks for hospitals and healthcare professionals in particular .
" We need to keep the positivity train moving for our ICUs , " she says .
" They say ' your health is your wealth ' but this applies to an entire nation ; that point is being proven right now .
" We need to step up and protect our healthcare workers ; that means their mental health , protective clothing and better pay for our nurses and student nurses .
We need to help them , so they can help us .
