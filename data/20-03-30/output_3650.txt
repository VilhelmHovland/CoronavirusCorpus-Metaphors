EPA-EFE/SHAWN THEW  WASHINGTON , March 30 ( Reuters ) - At last six members of the U .
Congress have announced that they have contracted the novel coronavirus , and more than 30 others are or were self-quarantining in hopes of limiting the spread of the pandemic .
Now that Congress has passed a $2 .
trillion economic relief bill , and President Donald Trump has signed it into law , neither the House of Representatives nor Senate is now due back in Washington before April 20 at the earliest .
An estimated 230 House members returned to Washington to pass the relief package on Friday , despite the health risks of traveling and gathering at the Capitol , after Republican Representative Thomas Massie said he would block an effort to pass it without at least half of the House 's 430 members present .
Here is a look at some of the lawmakers affected by the virus :  WHO HAS THE VIRUS ?  Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , announced in a statement on Monday that she had been diagnosed with a presumed case of coronavirus , although she had not been tested , after developing symptoms of the ailment on Sunday .
Velazquez was among the House members who returned to the Capitol on Friday .
Representative Mike Kelly  Kelly , a Republican from Pennsylvania , said on Friday he had tested positive for the coronavirus at a drive-through testing site .
Kelly said in a statement he had started experiencing mild flu-like symptoms , and his doctor ordered the coronavirus test .
Representative Joe Cunningham  Cunningham , a Democrat from South Carolina , said on Friday he had tested positive for the coronavirus , although his symptoms had already begun to improve .
Cunningham had been in self-quarantine since March 19 after learning he had been in contact with another member of Congress who had tested positive .
Senator Rand Paul  The Kentucky Republican said on March 22 that he had tested positive and was in quarantine .
He said he was asymptomatic and feeling fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been in the Senate and using the gym there in the days before he received his positive result .
Representative Mario Diaz-Balart  The Florida Republican said on March 18 that he tested positive after developing symptoms on March 14 .
That was less than 24 hours after he and more than 400 other members of the House of Representatives crowded into the chamber to pass an earlier coronavirus aid package .
Representative Ben McAdams  The Utah Democrat said on March 18 that he had the virus , also having developed symptoms on March 14 .
In a statement March 24 , McAdams said he had been in the hospital and doctors were monitoring his occasional need for oxygen .
He has since been released from the hospital .
WHO IS SELF-QUARANTINED ?  At least six of the 100 senators have self-quarantined because of exposure to Paul or others who tested positive for coronavirus .
They are Republicans Cory Gardner , Lindsey Graham , Rick Scott and Ted Cruz .
All have returned to public life .
More than two dozen House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McAdams , and others after contacts with constituents or staffers who tested positive .
Not all are still in isolation .
The Senate 's No .
2 Republican , John Thune , missed the March 25 Senate vote on the $2 .
trillion coronavirus bill after feeling ill and flying home to South Dakota .
He later announced that a coronavirus test had come back negative .
