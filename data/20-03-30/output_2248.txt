' We 're in this together , ' Canadiens captain Weber says of pandemic  " I got three kids so , needless to say , I 've been pretty busy , " Montreal Canadiens defenceman Shea Weber says of how he has been spending his free time since the NHL season was paused because of the coronavirus outbreak .
Captain Shea Weber is affectionately called " Dad " by his young teammates in the Canadiens ' locker room .
With the NHL season on hold and probably over because of the COVID-19 pandemic , Weber has had a lot of time to be a stay-at-home dad to his three young children while helping out his wife .
" I got three kids so , needless to say , I 've been pretty busy , " Weber said Monday afternoon during an NHL video conference call with the Florida Panthers ' Aleksander Barkov , the Buffalo Sabres ' Jack Eichel and the Tampa Bay Lightning 's Victor Hedman .
" A little bit of schoolwork and then , obviously , trying to keep them from killing each other throughout the day .
I plan activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" Only one of them is actually in school , " Weber added about his young kids .
" So it 's more just activities .
"  The Canadiens played their last game on March 10 , when they lost 4-2 to the Nashville Predators at the Bell Centre .
Two days later , the Canadiens arrived at the Bell Sports Complex in Brossard for a morning skate before a scheduled game that night against the Sabres .
" We had just gotten to the rink and we got called into a team meeting , " Weber recalled during the video conference call from his home on Montreal 's South Shore .
" They just said they could n't really say much more than we ca n't have a team meeting and everyone 's just got to go home until further notice .
Just got dressed , went home and then , obviously , all this kind of snowballed .
"  Later that day , NHL commissioner Gary Bettman announced the league would " pause " the season , starting with games that night .
@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some kind of a playoff and present the Stanley Cup this year , but that 's looking less likely with each passing week .
The Canadiens had 11 games left to play when the season was paused and were n't going to make the playoffs .
" I think anyone that 's going to be involved in the playoffs needs some sort of a buildup or some sort of training camp or something to get them ready because this is going to be quite an extended period of time off , " Weber said .
" This is so much bigger than hockey right now , " he added .
" The main priority is just making sure everyone is safe and getting healthy .
And when we do get back , then everyone will be excited to get back out there in front of our fans and whatever the circumstances or the situation is , I think everyone 's going to be excited to get going .
"  " We just have to all understand that we 're in this together and the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
" As soon as someone 's kind of messing around or not taking it seriously , that 's when things can turn bad for everyone .
The team reached out to me that the government wanted me to do something and I was willing to help out , for sure .
Hopefully it can influence or help some of those people that maybe wanted to go out or do something that they should n't .
It 's tough times , but we 've just got to stick together and come through this together .
"  Weber was asked if he could choose only one music album to listen to during the pandemic what it would be .
" For me , probably something country , " he said .
" I 'm not huge into names of albums and stuff , but maybe Luke Combs at this point is what I listen to the most .
"  Asked what TV shows he has been binge-watching during this time , Weber said : " I 'm big into the Vikings .
I just finished off the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that .
Obviously , I think a lot of people have seen Tiger King , so I 'm working my way through that .
Five episodes through that , so that 's what I 'm watching .
"  Weber also had a message for Canadiens fans and fans of the Nashville Predators , his old team .
" I just want to say merci and thank you guys for all your support and sticking with us through these tough times , " he said .
" It 's not easy for anyone .
It 's not easy for us , yourselves .
Obviously , the people in Nashville , tough times for you .
Not only the tornadoes that were right before this .
Hopefully you guys stay strong now coming through this virus coming next and I know you guys will .
It 's a good city and you guys are strong together .
" Obviously , the people here in Montreal , we 're looking forward to getting back in front of you guys at the Bell Centre whenever that time is .
