I do n't want to put a burden on my missus .

People need to stop being selfish because we 've felt the effects already .

" In England , there 's still people going to work and the underground is overcrowded .
Here I saw selfish scenes with people ransacking supermarket shelves .

Currently I am in Dagestan and I am training and preparing every day .
Although I do n't know what am I preparing for .

OK , go ahead , " he said .
" Everyone should follow the laws .
I am not against it , I know that fighters need to feed their families and pay their bills .
I know how hard it is for the fighter .
Unless they fight they are n't getting any money .
" I am even hearing that they are looking for an opponent for Tony , because he is in the States and I am here in Russia .
But I am here not on my own will .

" I know it 's a tough time for everyone at the moment , being locked indoors for so long .

I do n't want anyone to make the same mistake that I did .
" I urge everyone to stay at home and follow the rules and the guidelines of what we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept my apology and move on from this and hopefully in the near future we can all be out enjoying ourselves again .

"  Newcastle have placed members of their non-playing staff on furlough leave as the coronavirus pandemic continues to impact sport globally .

European Tour Chief Executive Keith Pelley said : " The decision to postpone the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open follows consultation with all stakeholders and was made with public health and well-being as our absolute priority .
" Our thoughts are with everyone right now and we are all united in trying to fight the spread of the pandemic .

"  Football finance expert Dr Rob Wilson believes the Premier League could reach a " crisis " of redundancies if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is currently suspended until April 30 at the earliest .
A meeting is to take place on April 3 to discuss the next steps , with a further postponement expected .
The idea of a World Cup-style football festival to finish the season in a month when sport can resume is being floated .
Matches would be played behind closed doors at neutral venues with teams staying isolated at local hotels .
Speaking to PA news agency , Dr Wilson said : " Failing to complete this season would leave clubs at crisis-talks stage .
" Clubs would be faced with asking questions like ' can players be paid , do they have to be made redundant , do we have to finish contracts early ' .
" So the intention will be that the season is finished , even if that 's much , much later .
" You could imagine the Premier League generating almost ? 1billion less television revenue income this year , as a consequence of games not being staged .
Hence the pressure on finishing the season .
" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's why they are being found out a bit now .
You will see Premier League clubs becoming more and more stressed as this goes on , because they simply have n't planned for that downturn in trade .
And they should have .
" Too many clubs lead that hand-to-mouth existence .
As soon as you see a problem , all of a sudden they are scrambling around because they have got no money coming in .
" They should always plan for eventualities , not necessarily a global health pandemic , but certainly downturns in trade .
" If you take the remaining television money out of the formula , then Premier League clubs will be struggling in exactly the same way as the League One and League Two clubs .
"  Over 60 Non-League chairmen have written an Open Letter to the FA fiercely contesting their decision to declare leagues within Step 3-7 of the English pyramid " null and void " .
The FA last week announced the seasons for non-league clubs below the National League were officially over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women 's football season from tiers three to seven also brought to an end .
The decision has been met with a ferocious backlash with imminent legal action expected .
The lack of consultation , hasty speed of the decision , negative financial implications and the impact on mental health were all topics highlighted in the letter .
Outlined below are some of the key points written in the statement :  " Our concern is grounded primarily in the needless and inexplicable haste exercised in reaching the decision , coupled with a total lack of substantive dialogue or consultation with affected clubs .
The decision also disregards the millions of pounds invested and countless hours expended collectively by clubs , and so has critical financial implications .
" Most clubs in steps three to six have now completed 70-80% of their league fixtures , and it is incomprehensible that these results should be delegitimised and expunged on the basis that the final quarter of the season can not be fulfilled in the future .
Simply put , there is no valid basis to expunge an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A crisis like this is a watershed moment for the FA and the relationship it chooses to have with non-league and grassroots football .
It is imperative to solve this issue sensibly and democratically over the coming weeks , with transparent , constructive and fair dialogue with respective leagues and clubs .
" We urge the FA to reconsider its decision and to slow down the whole process , offering proper consultation with afflicted leagues and clubs as the picture becomes clearer , before deciding a way forward .
"  WBO super-middleweight champion Billy Joe Saunders has had his British boxing licence suspended by the British Boxing Board of Control after posting a social media advising men how to hit their female partners .
The Brit was seen using a punch bag to demonstrate what to do if " your old woman is giving you mouth " in an incident promoter Eddie Hearn described as " idiotic " and " unacceptable " .
The Brit subsequently apologised for his actions , adding he intends to donate ? 25,000 to domestic violence charities .
Photo : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said it as a bit of a joke at first .
I was n't obviously thinking .
" It was a silly mistake but I did n't mean to cause any harm to anyone and I certainly would n't promote domestic violence .
I thought I would make a few people laugh but obviously it has flipped on the other side with people .
"  The BBBofC , however , said in a statement : " The British Boxing Board of Control , having considered comments made by Billy Joe Saunders on social media , have suspended his boxer 's licence pending a hearing under the board 's misconduct regulation , at a time and venue to be confirmed as soon as possible .

" Each Borough Council is creating hubs to receive the surplus food , divide it into food parcels and deliver them to the doorsteps of vulnerable Londoners -- our stadium will be one of two hubs used by Haringey , alongside Alexandra Palace .
" Boroughs are in touch with local charities , foodbanks and community centres , as well as the Government , to ascertain who is most vulnerable and in need .
"  Levy said : " As a Club , we have always been clear about our commitment to the wider community -- never has this been more important than it is now .

The international summer is due to begin on May 4 , with a Test between England and West Indies at the Kia Oval , but that series seems increasingly certain to be postponed .
The parlous financial state of most of the 18 first-class counties means that the entire summer being ruled out could threaten their existence and the ECB were meeting today to finalise plans for support packages .
It is likely that staff at the governing body are furloughed or take pay cuts , but at this stage pay cuts for centrally contracted England players are not being planned .

"  Wimbledon chiefs will announce on Wednesday that this year 's tournament has been cancelled , according to one of the sport 's leading figures .
Dirk Hordoff , vice-president of the German Tennis Federation , said that because the All England Lawn Tennis Club , who run Wimbledon , were insured for a pandemic , it was easier to pull the plug on the event .

I am also involved in the bodies of the ATP and WTA the sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The necessary decisions have already been made there and Wimbledon will decide to cancel on Wednesday .

" This is necessary in the current situation .
It is unrealistic to imagine that with travel restrictions in place that we have an international tournament where hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world would travel .
Wimbledon was the only Grand Slam tournament many years ago predictive enough to insure itself against a worldwide pandemic , so that the financial damage should be minimised there .
"  The Premier League season could be concluded in June and July amid the coronavirus pandemic using isolated " World Cup-style " camps , according to reports .
