' Overflow ' hospitals and PPE theft : What 's happening in Australian hospitals right now .
As the Australian community works towards flattening the coronavirus curve , our focus as a nation is on our country 's healthcare system , as we try to prepare it to cope with a growing number of sick .
The Morrison government has announced a $1 .
billion health package to deal with the COVID-19 crisis , however recent cuts to the industry could see hundreds of hospitals closing their doors in coming weeks .
650 private hospitals have been locked in crisis talks over the weekend , trying to come up with a solution with the government so they do n't have to leave critical ICU facilities un-utilised .
Elective surgery cuts .
The problems for private hospitals arose when the government announced the cutting back of elective surgeries last week .
Elective surgery is the biggest revenue stream for Australia 's private and Catholic hospitals , and without it many are looking at shutting their doors , with The Chronicle reporting it will put 100,000 critical health workers out of a job .

The Unexpected Silver Lining  The Robert Mueller Report  Australian Medical Association President Dr Tony Bartone told the Today Show , a deal was being discussed over the weekend and could be decided on as early as today .
" There is no way we can afford to lose all those beds , to lose in particular all of those ICU beds and indeed the staff , at this time as we approach an increasing crisis , " he stressed .
Michael Roff , CEO of the Australian Private Hospitals Association told The Chronicle : " The states do n't seem to understand the urgency of reaching a deal this weekend , if they do n't do that , the beds they need in a few weeks ' time may no longer be available " .
Access to supplies .
The federal health minister says one of the reasons elective surgery was cancelled was because of the issues around a lack of personal protective equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Show , Greg Hunt said : " We cancelled elective surgery because of the lack of PPE " .
" Probably two hours of every day of mine is focussed on the mask supplies , and the supplies of testing kits , " he added .

Ventilators are the other concern , with only 2000 available for use right now .
Hunt says that 's being increased to 4000 , and they 've ordered a further 5000 to be developed .
There are just over 40 people in ICU around Australia , but with more coronavirus cases coming in every day , that figure will rise .
One of the other things leading to a lack of supplies in hospitals is people stealing them .
Dr Andrew Rochford uploaded a video to Twitter yesterday explaining that he started his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end they had 10 bottles left .
" We found that someone had emptied one of these bottles and filled it with water .
So for an entire shift there were medical workers sanitising their hands between patients with water , " said Dr Rochford .
" You got to understand how dangerous that is .
"  " I understand everyone 's scared and everyone 's stressed , but we need to keep the protective gear in the hospitals .
"  What else is getting a funding boost ?  The majority of the $1 .
billion in health funding is going towards expanding Medicare subsidies and increasing tele-health services .
The latter Greg Hunt told the Today Show is " 10 years worth of work in 10 days , " and will include GP visits , and psychology and psychiatrist sessions over both the phone and video through Facetime and WhatsApp .
