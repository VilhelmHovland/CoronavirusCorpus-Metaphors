Funeral traditions which have survived millennia are now on hold  THE Irish wake , a cultural tradition that has survived thousands of years , has had to be foresaken due to the spread of the coronavirus .
Restrictions on gatherings and advice from the government have meant that the traditional ' Irish goodbye ' of large crowds and community support has been put on hold .
This has left families in the position where they can not say goodbye in a way they may have once imagined .
This is a situation that is likely to worsen over the coming weeks and months , with Italy banning funerals full stop due to the virus , robbing families of the chance to say a final goodbye .
John-Mark Griffin , of Griffin 's Funerals in John 's Gate , has seen the effect the coronavirus has had on funerals firsthand .
" The Covid-19 virus has seriously impacted on the way the traditional funeral is carried out .
It has also been a very difficult time for our own family as we 've had our own family bereavement this week , so we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , as the funeral director and as a mourning family member , " said Mr Griffin .
" As a funeral director , we have seen first hand that it has been very difficult for everyone .
Families in Limerick have , traditionally , had a massive and important culture of a certain style of funeral and that 's being seriously curtailed by the restrictions , obviously , which are all very understandable .
"  A funeral is always a time of loss , but these restrictions are adding to the stress a family may feel .
" So although the restrictions are very understandable , it can be difficult for families who often lean on the community for support and during the mourning time .
This can make it more difficult than normal .
We would have found the same thing as a bereaved family .
Because we have had to hold a different type of private service .
But we made the best of the situation , it was very personal and lovely in it 's own way .
" We found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sympathize with the family , through email , phone-in condolences and on-line with rip .
that , although they were n't the same thing , that they were still quite comforting .
"  The Irish Association of Funeral Directors , last Friday , released a statement advising that funerals be held behind closed doors and that no public advertisement of the funeral be released .
" Guidance form Health Service Executive ( HSE ) advises that funerals can be held privately behind closed doors with family and close friends can be present .
There should be no public advertisement of funeral arrangements -- in print or online -- but death notices can be placed without arrangements .
Families can advise friends and relations privately of funeral arrangements , " they said in a statement .
" There should be no provision for condolence book and pen at the funeral and public reposing must be discouraged as should funeral home gatherings .
Family gatherings should be by invite only and attendance restricted to below 100 .
Social distancing must be maintained with no handshaking or hugging .
Mourners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mass cards by post , " they added .
Mr Griffin says although he agrees with the measures , it does n't make it easier on the families .
" We 've been strongly advised by the Irish Association of Funeral Directors and the HSE in relation to gatherings and crowds .
These are ongoing and changing guidelines , and as we saw with our Taoiseach 's excellent delivery just this ( Tuesday ) evening , things will get worse before they recover .
" I think everyone is in agreement that the restrictions are genuinely needed , but it does n't make it any easier for be bereaved families at their already sad time .
The concept of the large memorial service that has been put on hold and I probably would feel that , based on our own bereavement , that the Memorial service at a future date is something that we will look forward to as a family .
Where family and friends can gather and remember their loved one .
