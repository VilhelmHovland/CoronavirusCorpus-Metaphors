An army of volunteers has been delivering emergency food parcels to Bristol 's most vulnerable people during the coronavirus pandemic .
A delivery of emergency goods supplied by central government was received at City Hall on Saturday morning ( March 28 ) before being packed into individual bags by Bristol City Council workers and volunteers .
