Christmas display just gets bigger every year .
Some people are flipping on their Christmas lights during the COVID-19 shutdown , to brighten up early spring evenings for those who have to work .
- Lawrence Powell  Today , I did something I 've never done before .
Three days after the first day of spring , I put out my outdoor Christmas lights .
I did this because the lights are a way to say thank you to all those unselfish people who are working so hard to get us all through this terrible virus .
If one of those workers , and there are hundreds , from doctors and nurses on down , happen to drive by my house , I hope their eyes and hearts light up with all our thanks .
The lights are for them when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have time for a break , for them when they do n't have time for their family , for them when they risk being so close to the virus .
It 's difficult to actually meet all who are working so hard for us , so please dig out your outside Christmas lights and light up the night for them .
The lights will let them know how much we thank them , street after street , home after home after home , heart after heart .
They are truly our guiding light .
So let 's get together , young and old , and light up our country for them .
