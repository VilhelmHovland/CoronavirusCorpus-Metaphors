The Edgell Jog has become the latest Bathurst event to be cancelled in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus .
Since it 's first edition in 1976 , the event has never been abandoned but Edgell Jog treasurer Ray Stapley said the committee made the tough decision last week to cancel this year 's instalment of the 7 .
" We felt like we could n't put our sponsors under pressure , " he said .
" They 're under enough pressure at the moment and we do n't know how long it 's going to last for .
" I know it 's six months away , but we can not wait until a month before and try and organise it .
" Mr Stapley said a decision was made last week , with the committee agreeing together to cancel this year 's event via email .
" We 're sending out letters to our sponsors and supporters now to let them know , " he said .
" People like Simplot are on board for next year , which is a real positive .
" Everyone I 've spoken to , they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our sponsors , some of them are n't operating .
That 's really sad .
" Mr Stapley said the committee will now work towards hosting the next Edgell Jog on September 19 , 2021 .
James Nipperess won last year 's Edgell Jog .
