Trump defends extending virus guidelines as spread continues  WASHINGTON -- Siding with public health experts ' dire projections , President Donald Trump on Monday defended his decision to extend restrictive social distancing guidelines through the end of April , while bracing the nation for a coronavirus death toll that could exceed 100,000 people .
" The worst that could happen is you do it too early and all of a sudden it comes back , " Trump said during a nearly hour-long call-in interview with " Fox &amp; Friends " as members of his coronavirus task force fanned out across other media outlets to warn the virus ' spread was only just beginning .
The comments came a day after Trump made a dramatic course reversal and announced that he would not be moving to ease the guidelines and get the economy back up and running by Easter on April 12 , as he said last week he hoped to do .
In the face of stark projections from his team and searing images of overwhelmed hospitals in his native New York City , Trump instead extended to April 30 the social distancing guidelines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states and local governments already have stiffer controls in place on mobility and gatherings .
Trump 's impulse to reopen the country , driven by pleas from business leaders , met a sober reality check from health experts , including Dr .
Anthony Fauci , the government 's top infectious disease expert , who on Sunday said the U .
could experience between 100,000-200,000 deaths and millions of infections from the pandemic .
That warning hardened a recognition in Washington that the struggle against the coronavirus will not be resolved quickly even as Trump expressed a longing for normalcy .
" It would not have been a good idea to pull back at a time when you really need to be pressing your foot on the pedal as opposed to on the brakes , " Fauci said on CNN on Monday , describing how he and Dr .
Deborah Birx , the coronavirus task force co-ordinator , had convinced Trump to reconsider .
" We showed him the data .
He looked at the data .
He got it right away , " Fauci said .
" It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in to the Oval Office and leaned over the desk and said , ' Here are the data .
Take a look .
' He just shook his head and said , ' I guess we got to do it .
' "  Americans are now being asked to prepare for at least another 30 days of severe economic and social disruption , with schools and businesses closed and public life is upended .
One in 3 Americans remain under state or local government orders to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus , and employment claims have already skyrocketed .
The federal guidelines recommend against group gatherings larger than 10 and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay home .
People are urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants , bars , nonessential travel and shopping trips .
Reflecting the extended restrictions , congressional officials on Monday said curbs on visitors to the U .
Capitol would last an additional month , through April .
All tours in the Capitol Visitor Center are halted and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed in the Capitol and congressional office buildings .
For more than a week , Trump had been bombarded by calls from outside business leaders who urged him to begin reopening the nation 's economy , at least in places with low infection rates , and warned of catastrophic consequences that could damage his reelection chances if it remained shuttered for much longer .
Trump told " Fox &amp; Friends " that " nobody " was " more worried " about the economic impact on the country than he was .
But he said , " We want to do something where we have the least death .
"  Trump , who has largely avoided talk of potential death and infection rates , cited projection models Sunday that said 2 .
million people or more could have died had social distancing measures not been put in place .
And he said the country would be doing well if it " can hold " the number of deaths " down to 100,000 .
"  In addition to the numbers , Trump said he was moved by harrowing scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native Queens .
He described the images he 'd seen on television with " body bags all over , in hallways .
I 've been watching them bring in trailer trucks -- freezer trucks .
because they ca n't handle the bodies , there are so many of them .
I 've seen things that I 've never seen before .
"  But experts warn that those scenes could play out across the country , as the virus spreads .
Birx and Fauci said even areas that have so far been spared must prepare for the eventuality that they , too , will become hot spots , with undetected cases likely in existence now .
" It 's critical that even if you do n't see it , it could be circulating in your community , " Birx told " CBS This Morning " on Monday .
Fauci said on ABC 's " Good Morning America " that smaller U .
cities are now ripe for the kind of acceleration that has occurred in New York .
" If you look throughout the country there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Fauci said .
" It looks like it 's low level , it starts to accelerate , then it goes way up .
"  The U .
had more than 140,000 COVID-19 cases reported by Monday morning , with more than 2,500 deaths , according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins .
Most people who contract COVID-19 have mild or moderate symptoms , which can include fever and cough but also milder cases of pneumonia , sometimes requiring hospitalization .
The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems .
Hospitals in the most afflicted areas are straining to handle patients and some are short of critical supplies .
In the " Fox &amp; Friends " interview , Trump also said his administration was considering providing hazard pay for medical professionals who are on the front lines of the pandemic .
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin agreed , telling Fox Business Network in a separate interview that the idea " makes a lot of sense " and is " definitely something we 'll put in the next bill .
" Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be needed .
