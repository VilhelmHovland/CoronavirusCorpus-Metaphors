Your daily fix of hope &amp; gratitude in uncertain times  Every news report contains some frightening stats on the coronavirus pandemic -- and reading about escalating international death tolls , ventilator rationing and the collapse of the global economy contributes to rising levels of depression and anxiety among even the most positive and resilient among us .
That 's why we are bringing you an inspiring story every day during this lockdown -- so you can read about what fellow South Africans are doing for each other -- to bring some good news into your homes , and give you some hope for the future .
when the world beats this virus and we rebuild our nation together .
Today we 're ( re ) publishing a post from Jane Kuzlo that has gone viral : a reminder to be grateful for your home and your family and the choices you still have under lockdown in your house .
choices that many other South Africans would love to share too , but do n't .
Privilege as defined by Covid-19 ( written by Jane Kuzlo )  You bemoan the unfairness of being allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run or walk your dogs , while others are wondering how they will shop from a locked-down township with no public transport .
You worry if you 've stocked up with enough wine , treats and good food , while others are wondering how they will feed their families from next week .
WIN a R 2,000 Woolworths Voucher  You begrudging buy the last of the no-name sanitizer because your brand is sold out , while others wonder how to wash their children 's hands with no running water .
You ca n't believe you have to spend 21 days inside , with the partners you chose and the babies you made in your 3 bedroom homes , while others wonder where they are going to put their grandmother when they are already 10 to a 1 bedroom shack .
You wonder how you will pass the days between Netflix , your garden , puzzles and books , while others are wondering how to keep their families and the vulnerable safe in overrun townships with no infrastructure .
Corona does n't discriminate .
But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are not , are most likely going to die if this virus makes itself at known in their homes .
We are a nation who has 300 000 people living with TB .
Over 7 million living with HIV .
Hundreds of thousands with compromised immunity from disease , chemo , circumstance .
For them catching corona may well be a death sentence .
So stop being so self-absorbed .
Stay home .
Be grateful .
And think of ways to heal our broken economy once this is all over .
We can make it through the other side IF we do it together .
